    "Discovering new code words in declassified CIA documents may seem like a mission for a foreign intelligence service, and detecting gender biases in the Harry Potter novels a task for a literature professor. Yet by utilizing natural language parsing with regular expressions, the power to perform such analyses is in your own hands!\n",

    "While you may not put much explicit thought into the structure of your sentences as you write, the syntax choices you make are critical in ensuring your writing has meaning. Analyzing such sentence structure as well as word choice can not only provide insights into the connotation of a piece text, but can also highlight the biases of its author or uncover additional insights that even a deep, rigorous reading of the text might not reveal.\n",

    "By using Python’s regular expression modulere and the Natural Language Toolkit, known as NLTK, you can find keywords of interest, discover where and how often they are used, and discern the parts-of-speech patterns in which they appear to understand the sometimes hidden meaning in a piece of writing.

    "#Introduction to Chunking\n",
    "You have made it to the juicy stuff! Given your part-of-speech tagged text, you can now use regular expressions to find patterns in sentence structure that give insight into the meaning of a text. This technique of grouping words by their part-of-speech tag is called chunking.\n",
    "\n",
    "With chunking in nltk, you can define a pattern of parts-of-speech tags using a modified notation of regular expressions. You can then find non-overlapping matches, or chunks of words, in the part-of-speech tagged sentences of a text.\n",
    "\n",
    "The regular expression you build to find chunks is called chunk grammar. A piece of chunk grammar can be written as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "chunk_grammar = \"AN: {<JJ><NN>}\"\n",
    "AN is a user-defined name for the kind of chunk you are searching for. You can use whatever name makes sense given your chunk grammar. In this case AN stands for adjective-noun\n",
    "A pair of curly braces {} surround the actual chunk grammar\n",
    "<JJ> operates similarly to a regex character class, matching any adjective\n",
    "<NN> matches any noun, singular or plural\n",
    "The chunk grammar above will thus match any adjective that is followed by a noun.\n",
    "\n",
    "To use the chunk grammar defined, you must create a nltk RegexpParser object and give it a piece of chunk grammar as an argument.\n",
    "\n",
    "chunk_parser = RegexpParser(chunk_grammar)\n",
    "You can then use the RegexpParser object’s .parse() method, which takes a list of part-of-speech tagged words as an argument, and identifies where such chunks occur in the sentence!\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the part-of-speech tagged sentence below:\n",
    "\n",
    "pos_tagged_sentence = [('where', 'WRB'), ('is', 'VBZ'), ('the', 'DT'), ('emerald', 'JJ'), ('city', 'NN'), ('?', '.')]\n",
    "You can chunk the sentence to find any adjectives followed by a noun with the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "chunked = chunk_parser.parse(pos_tagged_sentence)"
