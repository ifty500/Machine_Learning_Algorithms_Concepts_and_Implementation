    "### Noise removal — stripping text of formatting (e.g., HTML tags).\n",

    "\n",
    "One of the most common language models is the unigram model, a statistical language model commonly known as bag-of-words. As its name suggests, bag-of-words does not have much order to its chaos! What it does have is a tally count of each instance for each word. Consider the following text example:\n",

    "<img src=\"images/bag-of-words.gif\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\">\n",

    "You can see how even with different word order and sentence structures, “jump,” “squid,” and “suitcase” are shared topics between the two examples. Bag-of-words can be an excellent way of looking at language when you want to make predictions concerning topic or sentiment of a text.

Im one that has spoken to a King, I am: mayhap youll never see such another: and to show you Im not proud, you may shake hands with me! And he grinned almost from ear to ear, as he leant forwards (and as nearly as possible fell off the wall in doing so) and offered Alice his hand. She watched him a little anxiously as she took it. If he smiled much more, the ends of his mouth might meet behind, she thought: and then I dont know what would happen to his head! Im afraid it would come off!\n",

    "\n",
    "For parsing entire phrases or conducting language prediction, you will want to use a model that pays attention to each word’s neighbors. Unlike bag-of-words, the n-gram model considers a sequence of some number (n) units and calculates the probability of each unit in a body of language given the preceding sequence of length n. Because of this, n-gram probabilities with larger n values can be impressive at language prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "Take a look at our revised squid example: “The squids jumped out of the suitcases. The squids were furious.”\n",

During training, your model will probably come across test words that it has never encountered before (this issue also pertains to bag of words). A tactic known as language smoothing can help adjust probabilities for unknown words, but it isn’t always ideal.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* For a model that more accurately predicts human language patterns, you want n (your sequence length) to be as large as possible. That way, you will have more natural sounding language, right? Well, as the sequence length grows, the number of examples of each sequence within your training corpus shrinks. With too few examples, you won’t have enough data to make many predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",

    " CHAPTER I. Looking-Glass house\n",
    "\n",
    "One thing was certain, that the white kitten had had nothing to do with it:it was the black kittens fault entirely. For the white kitten had been having its face washed by the old cat for the last quarter of an hour (and bearing it pretty well, considering); so you see that it couldnt have had any hand in the mischief.\n",
    "\n",
    "The way Dinah washed her childrens faces was this: first she held the poor thing down by its ear with one paw, and then with the other paw she rubbed its face all over, the wrong way, beginning at the nose: and just now, as I said, she was hard at work on the white kitten, which was lying quite still and trying to purrno doubt feeling that it was all meant for its good.\n",
    "\n",
    "But the black kitten had been finished with earlier in the afternoon, and so, while Alice was sitting curled up in a corner of the great arm-chair, half talking to herself and half asleep, the kitten had been having a grand game of romps with the ball of worsted Alice had been trying to wind up, and had been rolling it up and down till it had all come undone again; and there it was, spread over the hearth-rug, all knots and tangles, with the kitten running after its own tail in the middle.\n",
    "\n",
    "Oh, you wicked little thing! cried Alice, catching up the kitten, and giving it a little kiss to make it understand that it was in disgrace. Really, Dinah ought to have taught you better manners! You ought, Dinah, you know you ought! she added, looking reproachfully at the old cat, and speaking in as cross a voice as she could manageand then she scrambled back into the arm-chair, taking the kitten and the worsted with her, and began winding up the ball again. But she didnt get on very fast, as she was talking all the time, sometimes to the kitten, and sometimes to herself. Kitty sat very demurely on her knee, pretending to watch the progress of the winding, and now and then putting out one paw and gently touching the ball, as if it would be glad to help, if it might.\n",
    "\n",
    "Do you know what to-morrow is, Kitty? Alice began. Youd have guessed if youd been up in the window with meonly Dinah was making you tidy, so you couldnt. I was watching the boys getting in sticks for the bonfireand it wants plenty of sticks, Kitty! Only it got so cold, and it snowed so, they had to leave off. Never mind, Kitty, well go and see the bonfire to-morrow. Here Alice wound two or three turns of the worsted round the kittens neck, just to see how it would look: this led to a scramble, in which the ball rolled down upon the floor, and yards and yards of it got unwound again.\n",
    "\n",
    "Do you know, I was so angry, Kitty, Alice went on as soon as they were comfortably settled again, when I saw all the mischief you had been doing, I was very nearly opening the window, and putting you out into the snow! And youd have deserved it, you little mischievous darling! What have you got to say for yourself? Now dont interrupt me! she went on, holding up one finger. Im going to tell you all your faults. Number one: you squeaked twice while Dinah was washing your face this morning. Now you cant deny it, Kitty: I heard you! Whats that you say? (pretending that the kitten was speaking.) Her paw went into your eye? Well, thats your fault, for keeping your eyes openif youd shut them tight up, it wouldnt have happened. Now dont make any more excuses, but listen! Number two: you pulled Snowdrop away by the tail just as I had put down the saucer of milk before her! What, you were thirsty, were you? How do you know she wasnt thirsty too? Now for number three: you unwound every bit of the worsted while I wasnt looking!\n",
    "\n",
    "Thats three faults, Kitty, and youve not been punished for any of them yet. You know Im saving up all your punishments for Wednesday weekSuppose they had saved up all my punishments! she went on, talking more to herself than the kitten. What would they do at the end of a year? I should be sent to prison, I suppose, when the day came. Orlet me seesuppose each punishment was to be going without a dinner: then, when the miserable day came, I should have to go without fifty dinners at once! Well, I shouldnt mind that much! Id far rather go without them than eat them!\n",
    "\n",
    "Do you hear the snow against the window-panes, Kitty? How nice and soft it sounds! Just as if some one was kissing the window all over outside. I wonder if the snow loves the trees and fields, that it kisses them so gently? And then it covers them up snug, you know, with a white quilt; and perhaps it says, Go to sleep, darlings, till the summer comes again. And when they wake up in the summer, Kitty, they dress themselves all in green, and dance aboutwhenever the wind blowsoh, thats very pretty! cried Alice, dropping the ball of worsted to clap her hands. And I do so wish it was true! Im sure the woods look sleepy in the autumn, when the leaves are getting brown.\n",
    "\n",
    "Kitty, can you play chess? Now, dont smile, my dear, Im asking it seriously. Because, when we were playing just now, you watched just as if you understood it: and when I said Check! you purred! Well, it was a nice check, Kitty, and really I might have won, if it hadnt been for that nasty Knight, that came wiggling down among my pieces. Kitty, dear, lets pretend And here I wish I could tell you half the things Alice used to say, beginning with her favourite phrase Lets pretend. She had had quite a long argument with her sister only the day beforeall because Alice had begun with Lets pretend were kings and queens; and her sister, who liked being very exact, had argued that they couldnt, because there were only two of them, and Alice had been reduced at last to say, Well, you can be one of them then, and Ill be all the rest. And once she had really frightened her old nurse by shouting suddenly in her ear, Nurse! Do lets pretend that Im a hungry hyaena, and youre a bone.\n",
    "\n",
    "But this is taking us away from Alices speech to the kitten. Lets pretend that youre the Red Queen, Kitty! Do you know, I think if you sat up and folded your arms, youd look exactly like her. Now do try, theres a dear! And Alice got the Red Queen off the table, and set it up before the kitten as a model for it to imitate: however, the thing didnt succeed, principally, Alice said, because the kitten wouldnt fold its arms properly. So, to punish it, she held it up to the Looking-glass, that it might see how sulky it wasand if youre not good directly, she added, Ill put you through into Looking-glass House. How would you like that?\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, if youll only attend, Kitty, and not talk so much, Ill tell you all my ideas about Looking-glass House. First, theres the room you can see through the glassthats just the same as our drawing room, only the things go the other way. I can see all of it when I get upon a chairall but the bit behind the fireplace. Oh! I do so wish I could see that bit! I want so much to know whether theyve a fire in the winter: you never can tell, you know, unless our fire smokes, and then smoke comes up in that room toobut that may be only pretence, just to make it look as if they had a fire. Well then, the books are something like our books, only the words go the wrong way; I know that, because Ive held up one of our books to the glass, and then they hold up one in the other room.\n",
    "\n",
    "How would you like to live in Looking-glass House, Kitty? I wonder if theyd give you milk in there? Perhaps Looking-glass milk isnt good to drinkBut oh, Kitty! now we come to the passage. You can just see a little peep of the passage in Looking-glass House, if you leave the door of our drawing-room wide open: and its very like our passage as far as you can see, only you know it may be quite different on beyond. Oh, Kitty! how nice it would be if we could only get through into Looking-glass House! Im sure its got, oh! such beautiful things in it! Lets pretend theres a way of getting through into it, somehow, Kitty. Lets pretend the glass has got all soft like gauze, so that we can get through. Why, its turning into a sort of mist now, I declare! Itll be easy enough to get through She was up on the chimney-piece while she said this, though she hardly knew how she had got there. And certainly the glass was beginning to melt away, just like a bright silvery mist.\n",
    "\n",
    "In another moment Alice was through the glass, and had jumped lightly down into the Looking-glass room. The very first thing she did was to look whether there was a fire in the fireplace, and she was quite pleased to find that there was a real one, blazing away as brightly as the one she had left behind. So I shall be as warm here as I was in the old room, thought Alice: warmer, in fact, because therell be no one here to scold me away from the fire. Oh, what fun itll be, when they see me through the glass in here, and cant get at me!\n",
    "\n",
    "Then she began looking about, and noticed that what could be seen from the old room was quite common and uninteresting, but that all the rest was as different as possible. For instance, the pictures on the wall next the fire seemed to be all alive, and the very clock on the chimney-piece (you know you can only see the back of it in the Looking-glass) had got the face of a little old man, and grinned at her.\n",
    "\n",
    "They dont keep this room so tidy as the other, Alice thought to herself, as she noticed several of the chessmen down in the hearth among the cinders: but in another moment, with a little Oh! of surprise, she was down on her hands and knees watching them. The chessmen were walking about, two and two!\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are the Red King and the Red Queen, Alice said (in a whisper, for fear of frightening them), and there are the White King and the White Queen sitting on the edge of the shoveland here are two castles walking arm in armI dont think they can hear me, she went on, as she put her head closer down, and Im nearly sure they cant see me. I feel somehow as if I were invisible\n",
    "\n",
    "Here something began squeaking on the table behind Alice, and made her turn her head just in time to see one of the White Pawns roll over and begin kicking: she watched it with great curiosity to see what would happen next.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is the voice of my child! the White Queen cried out as she rushed past the King, so violently that she knocked him over among the cinders. My precious Lily! My imperial kitten! and she began scrambling wildly up the side of the fender.\n",
    "\n",
    "Imperial fiddlestick! said the King, rubbing his nose, which had been hurt by the fall. He had a right to be a little annoyed with the Queen, for he was covered with ashes from head to foot.\n",
    "\n",
    "Alice was very anxious to be of use, and, as the poor little Lily was nearly screaming herself into a fit, she hastily picked up the Queen and set her on the table by the side of her noisy little daughter.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Queen gasped, and sat down: the rapid journey through the air had quite taken away her breath and for a minute or two she could do nothing but hug the little Lily in silence. As soon as she had recovered her breath a little, she called out to the White King, who was sitting sulkily among the ashes, Mind the volcano!\n",
    "\n",
    "What volcano? said the King, looking up anxiously into the fire, as if he thought that was the most likely place to find one.\n",
    "\n",
    "Blewmeup, panted the Queen, who was still a little out of breath. Mind you come upthe regular waydont get blown up!\n",
    "\n",
    "Alice watched the White King as he slowly struggled up from bar to bar, till at last she said, Why, youll be hours and hours getting to the table, at that rate. Id far better help you, hadnt I? But the King took no notice of the question: it was quite clear that he could neither hear her nor see her.\n",
    "\n",
    "So Alice picked him up very gently, and lifted him across more slowly than she had lifted the Queen, that she mightnt take his breath away: but, before she put him on the table, she thought she might as well dust him a little, he was so covered with ashes.\n",
    "\n",
    "She said afterwards that she had never seen in all her life such a face as the King made, when he found himself held in the air by an invisible hand, and being dusted: he was far too much astonished to cry out, but his eyes and his mouth went on getting larger and larger, and rounder and rounder, till her hand shook so with laughing that she nearly let him drop upon the floor.\n",
    "\n",
    "Oh! please dont make such faces, my dear! she cried out, quite forgetting that the King couldnt hear her. You make me laugh so that I can hardly hold you! And dont keep your mouth so wide open! All the ashes will get into itthere, now I think youre tidy enough! she added, as she smoothed his hair, and set him upon the table near the Queen.\n",
    "\n",
    "The King immediately fell flat on his back, and lay perfectly still: and Alice was a little alarmed at what she had done, and went round the room to see if she could find any water to throw over him. However, she could find nothing but a bottle of ink, and when she got back with it she found he had recovered, and he and the Queen were talking together in a frightened whisperso low, that Alice could hardly hear what they said.\n",
    "\n",
    "The King was saying, I assure, you my dear, I turned cold to the very ends of my whiskers!\n",
    "\n",
    "To which the Queen replied, You havent got any whiskers.\n",
    "\n",
    "The horror of that moment, the King went on, I shall never, never forget!\n",
    "\n",
    "You will, though, the Queen said, if you dont make a memorandum of it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Alice looked on with great interest as the King took an enormous memorandum-book out of his pocket, and began writing. A sudden thought struck her, and she took hold of the end of the pencil, which came some way over his shoulder, and began writing for him.\n",
    "\n",
    "The poor King looked puzzled and unhappy, and struggled with the pencil for some time without saying anything; but Alice was too strong for him, and at last he panted out, My dear! I really must get a thinner pencil. I cant manage this one a bit; it writes all manner of things that I dont intend\n",
    "\n",
    "What manner of things? said the Queen, looking over the book (in which Alice had put The White Knight is sliding down the poker. He balances very badly) Thats not a memorandum of your feelings!\n",
    "\n",
    "There was a book lying near Alice on the table, and while she sat watching the White King (for she was still a little anxious about him, and had the ink all ready to throw over him, in case he fainted again), she turned over the leaves, to find some part that she could read, for its all in some language I dont know, she said to herself.\n",

    "\n",
    "But oh! thought Alice, suddenly jumping up, if I dont make haste I shall have to go back through the Looking-glass, before Ive seen what the rest of the house is like! Lets have a look at the garden first! She was out of the room in a moment, and ran down stairsor, at least, it wasnt exactly running, but a new invention of hers for getting down stairs quickly and easily, as Alice said to herself. She just kept the tips of her fingers on the hand-rail, and floated gently down without even touching the stairs with her feet; then she floated on through the hall, and would have gone straight out at the door in the same way, if she hadnt caught hold of the door-post. She was getting a little giddy with so much floating in the air, and was rather glad to find herself walking again in the natural way.\n",

    "CHAPTER II. The Garden of Live Flowers\n",
    "\n",
    "I should see the garden far better, said Alice to herself, if I could get to the top of that hill: and heres a path that leads straight to itat least, no, it doesnt do that (after going a few yards along the path, and turning several sharp corners), but I suppose it will at last. But how curiously it twists! Its more like a corkscrew than a path! Well, this turn goes to the hill, I supposeno, it doesnt! This goes straight back to the house! Well then, Ill try it the other way.\n",
    "\n",
    "And so she did: wandering up and down, and trying turn after turn, but always coming back to the house, do what she would. Indeed, once, when she turned a corner rather more quickly than usual, she ran against it before she could stop herself.\n",
    "\n",
    "Its no use talking about it, Alice said, looking up at the house and pretending it was arguing with her. Im not going in again yet. I know I should have to get through the Looking-glass againback into the old roomand thered be an end of all my adventures!\n",
    "\n",
    "So, resolutely turning her back upon the house, she set out once more down the path, determined to keep straight on till she got to the hill. For a few minutes all went on well, and she was just saying, I really shall do it this time when the path gave a sudden twist and shook itself (as she described it afterwards), and the next moment she found herself actually walking in at the door.\n",
    "\n",
    "Oh, its too bad! she cried. I never saw such a house for getting in the way! Never!\n",
    "\n",
    "However, there was the hill full in sight, so there was nothing to be done but start again. This time she came upon a large flower-bed, with a border of daisies, and a willow-tree growing in the middle.\n",
    "\n",
    "O Tiger-lily, said Alice, addressing herself to one that was waving gracefully about in the wind, I wish you could talk!\n",
    "\n",
    "We can talk, said the Tiger-lily: when theres anybody worth talking to.\n",
    "\n",
    "Alice was so astonished that she could not speak for a minute: it quite seemed to take her breath away. At length, as the Tiger-lily only went on waving about, she spoke again, in a timid voicealmost in a whisper. And can all the flowers talk?\n",
    "\n",
    "As well as you can, said the Tiger-lily. And a great deal louder.\n",
    "\n",
    "It isnt manners for us to begin, you know, said the Rose, and I really was wondering when youd speak! Said I to myself, Her face has got some sense in it, though its not a clever one! Still, youre the right colour, and that goes a long way.\n",
    "\n",
    "I dont care about the colour, the Tiger-lily remarked. If only her petals curled up a little more, shed be all right.\n",
    "\n",
    "Alice didnt like being criticised, so she began asking questions. Arent you sometimes frightened at being planted out here, with nobody to take care of you?\n",
    "\n",
    "Theres the tree in the middle, said the Rose: what else is it good for?\n",
    "\n",
    "But what could it do, if any danger came? Alice asked.\n",
    "\n",
    "It says Bough-wough! cried a Daisy: thats why its branches are called boughs!\n",
    "\n",
    "Didnt you know that? cried another Daisy, and here they all began shouting together, till the air seemed quite full of little shrill voices. Silence, every one of you! cried the Tiger-lily, waving itself passionately from side to side, and trembling with excitement. They know I cant get at them! it panted, bending its quivering head towards Alice, or they wouldnt dare to do it!\n",
    "\n",
    "Never mind! Alice said in a soothing tone, and stooping down to the daisies, who were just beginning again, she whispered, If you dont hold your tongues, Ill pick you!\n",
    "\n",
    "There was silence in a moment, and several of the pink daisies turned white.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thats right! said the Tiger-lily. The daisies are worst of all. When one speaks, they all begin together, and its enough to make one wither to hear the way they go on!\n",
    "\n",
    "How is it you can all talk so nicely? Alice said, hoping to get it into a better temper by a compliment. Ive been in many gardens before, but none of the flowers could talk.\n",
    "\n",
    "Put your hand down, and feel the ground, said the Tiger-lily. Then youll know why.\n",
    "\n",
    "Alice did so. Its very hard, she said, but I dont see what that has to do with it.\n",
    "\n",
    "In most gardens, the Tiger-lily said, they make the beds too softso that the flowers are always asleep.\n",
    "\n",
    "This sounded a very good reason, and Alice was quite pleased to know it. I never thought of that before! she said.\n",
    "\n",
    "Its my opinion that you never think at all, the Rose said in a rather severe tone.\n",
    "\n",
    "I never saw anybody that looked stupider, a Violet said, so suddenly, that Alice quite jumped; for it hadnt spoken before.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hold your tongue! cried the Tiger-lily. As if you ever saw anybody! You keep your head under the leaves, and snore away there, till you know no more whats going on in the world, than if you were a bud!\n",
    "\n",
    "Are there any more people in the garden besides me? Alice said, not choosing to notice the Roses last remark.\n",
    "\n",
    "Theres one other flower in the garden that can move about like you, said the Rose. I wonder how you do it (Youre always wondering, said the Tiger-lily), but shes more bushy than you are.\n",
    "\n",
    "Is she like me? Alice asked eagerly, for the thought crossed her mind, Theres another little girl in the garden, somewhere!\n",
    "\n",
    "Well, she has the same awkward shape as you, the Rose said, but shes redderand her petals are shorter, I think.\n",
    "\n",
    "Her petals are done up close, almost like a dahlia, the Tiger-lily interrupted: not tumbled about anyhow, like yours.\n",
    "\n",
    "But thats not your fault, the Rose added kindly: youre beginning to fade, you knowand then one cant help ones petals getting a little untidy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Alice didnt like this idea at all: so, to change the subject, she asked Does she ever come out here?\n",
    "\n",
    "I daresay youll see her soon, said the Rose. Shes one of the thorny kind.\n",
    "\n",
    "Where does she wear the thorns? Alice asked with some curiosity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why all round her head, of course, the Rose replied. I was wondering you hadnt got some too. I thought it was the regular rule.\n",
    "\n",
    "Shes coming! cried the Larkspur. I hear her footstep, thump, thump, thump, along the gravel-walk!\n",
    "\n",
    "Alice looked round eagerly, and found that it was the Red Queen. Shes grown a good deal! was her first remark. She had indeed: when Alice first found her in the ashes, she had been only three inches highand here she was, half a head taller than Alice herself!\n",
    "\n",
    "Its the fresh air that does it, said the Rose: wonderfully fine air it is, out here.\n",
    "\n",
    "I think Ill go and meet her, said Alice, for, though the flowers were interesting enough, she felt that it would be far grander to have a talk with a real Queen.\n",
    "\n",
    "You cant possibly do that, said the Rose: I should advise you to walk the other way.\n",
    "\n",
    "This sounded nonsense to Alice, so she said nothing, but set off at once towards the Red Queen. To her surprise, she lost sight of her in a moment, and found herself walking in at the front-door again.\n",
    "\n",
    "A little provoked, she drew back, and after looking everywhere for the queen (whom she spied out at last, a long way off), she thought she would try the plan, this time, of walking in the opposite direction.\n",
    "\n",
    "It succeeded beautifully. She had not been walking a minute before she found herself face to face with the Red Queen, and full in sight of the hill she had been so long aiming at.\n",
    "\n",
    "Where do you come from? said the Red Queen. And where are you going? Look up, speak nicely, and dont twiddle your fingers all the time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Alice attended to all these directions, and explained, as well as she could, that she had lost her way.\n",
    "\n",
    "I dont know what you mean by your way, said the Queen: all the ways about here belong to mebut why did you come out here at all? she added in a kinder tone. Curtsey while youre thinking what to say, it saves time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Alice wondered a little at this, but she was too much in awe of the Queen to disbelieve it. Ill try it when I go home, she thought to herself, the next time Im a little late for dinner.\n",
    "\n",
    "Its time for you to answer now, the Queen said, looking at her watch: open your mouth a little wider when you speak, and always say your Majesty.\n",
    "\n",
    "I only wanted to see what the garden was like, your Majesty\n",
    "\n",
    "Thats right, said the Queen, patting her on the head, which Alice didnt like at all, though, when you say garden,Ive seen gardens, compared with which this would be a wilderness.\n",
    "\n",
    "Alice didnt dare to argue the point, but went on: and I thought Id try and find my way to the top of that hill\n",
    "\n",
    "When you say hill, the Queen interrupted, I could show you hills, in comparison with which youd call that a valley.\n",
    "\n",
    "No, I shouldnt, said Alice, surprised into contradicting her at last: a hill cant be a valley, you know. That would be nonsense\n",
    "\n",
    "The Red Queen shook her head, You may call it nonsense if you like, she said, but Ive heard nonsense, compared with which that would be as sensible as a dictionary!\n",
    "\n",
    "Alice curtseyed again, as she was afraid from the Queens tone that she was a little offended: and they walked on in silence till they got to the top of the little hill.\n",
    "\n",
    "For some minutes Alice stood without speaking, looking out in all directions over the countryand a most curious country it was. There were a number of tiny little brooks running straight across it from side to side, and the ground between was divided up into squares by a number of little green hedges, that reached from brook to brook.\n",
    "\n",
    "I declare its marked out just like a large chessboard! Alice said at last. There ought to be some men moving about somewhereand so there are! She added in a tone of delight, and her heart began to beat quick with excitement as she went on. Its a great huge game of chess thats being playedall over the worldif this is the world at all, you know. Oh, what fun it is! How I wish I was one of them! I wouldnt mind being a Pawn, if only I might jointhough of course I should like to be a Queen, best.\n",
    "\n",
    "She glanced rather shyly at the real Queen as she said this, but her companion only smiled pleasantly, and said, Thats easily managed. You can be the White Queens Pawn, if you like, as Lilys too young to play; and youre in the Second Square to begin with: when you get to the Eighth Square youll be a Queen Just at this moment, somehow or other, they began to run.\n",
    "\n",
    "Alice never could quite make out, in thinking it over afterwards, how it was that they began: all she remembers is, that they were running hand in hand, and the Queen went so fast that it was all she could do to keep up with her: and still the Queen kept crying Faster! Faster! but Alice felt she could not go faster, though she had not breath left to say so.\n",
    "\n",
    "The most curious part of the thing was, that the trees and the other things round them never changed their places at all: however fast they went, they never seemed to pass anything. I wonder if all the things move along with us? thought poor puzzled Alice. And the Queen seemed to guess her thoughts, for she cried, Faster! Dont try to talk!\n",
    "\n",
    "Not that Alice had any idea of doing that. She felt as if she would never be able to talk again, she was getting so much out of breath: and still the Queen cried Faster! Faster! and dragged her along. Are we nearly there? Alice managed to pant out at last.\n",
    "\n",
    "Nearly there! the Queen repeated. Why, we passed it ten minutes ago! Faster! And they ran on for a time in silence, with the wind whistling in Alices ears, and almost blowing her hair off her head, she fancied.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now! Now! cried the Queen. Faster! Faster! And they went so fast that at last they seemed to skim through the air, hardly touching the ground with their feet, till suddenly, just as Alice was getting quite exhausted, they stopped, and she found herself sitting on the ground, breathless and giddy.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Queen propped her up against a tree, and said kindly, You may rest a little now.\n",
    "\n",
    "Alice looked round her in great surprise. Why, I do believe weve been under this tree the whole time! Everythings just as it was!\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course it is, said the Queen, what would you have it?\n",
    "\n",
    "Well, in our country, said Alice, still panting a little, youd generally get to somewhere elseif you ran very fast for a long time, as weve been doing.\n",
    "\n",
    "A slow sort of country! said the Queen. Now, here, you see, it takes all the running you can do, to keep in the same place. If you want to get somewhere else, you must run at least twice as fast as that!\n",
    "\n",
    "Id rather not try, please! said Alice. Im quite content to stay hereonly I am so hot and thirsty!\n",
    "\n",
    "I know what youd like! the Queen said good-naturedly, taking a little box out of her pocket. Have a biscuit?\n",
    "\n",
    "Alice thought it would not be civil to say No, though it wasnt at all what she wanted. So she took it, and ate it as well as she could: and it was very dry; and she thought she had never been so nearly choked in all her life.\n",
    "\n",
    "While youre refreshing yourself, said the Queen, Ill just take the measurements. And she took a ribbon out of her pocket, marked in inches, and began measuring the ground, and sticking little pegs in here and there.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the end of two yards, she said, putting in a peg to mark the distance, I shall give you your directionshave another biscuit?\n",
    "\n",
    "No, thank you, said Alice: ones quite enough!\n",
    "\n",
    "Thirst quenched, I hope? said the Queen.\n",
    "\n",
    "Alice did not know what to say to this, but luckily the Queen did not wait for an answer, but went on. At the end of three yards I shall repeat themfor fear of your forgetting them. At the end of four, I shall say good-bye. And at the end of five, I shall go!\n",
    "\n",
    "She had got all the pegs put in by this time, and Alice looked on with great interest as she returned to the tree, and then began slowly walking down the row.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the two-yard peg she faced round, and said, A pawn goes two squares in its first move, you know. So youll go very quickly through the Third Squareby railway, I should thinkand youll find yourself in the Fourth Square in no time. Well, that square belongs to Tweedledum and Tweedledeethe Fifth is mostly waterthe Sixth belongs to Humpty DumptyBut you make no remark?\n",
    "\n",
    "II didnt know I had to make onejust then, Alice faltered out.\n",
    "\n",
    "You should have said, Its extremely kind of you to tell me all thishowever, well suppose it saidthe Seventh Square is all foresthowever, one of the Knights will show you the wayand in the Eighth Square we shall be Queens together, and its all feasting and fun! Alice got up and curtseyed, and sat down again.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the next peg the Queen turned again, and this time she said, Speak in French when you cant think of the English for a thingturn out your toes as you walkand remember who you are! She did not wait for Alice to curtsey this time, but walked on quickly to the next peg, where she turned for a moment to say good-bye, and then hurried on to the last.\n",
    "\n",
    "How it happened, Alice never knew, but exactly as she came to the last peg, she was gone. Whether she vanished into the air, or whether she ran quickly into the wood (and she can run very fast! thought Alice), there was no way of guessing, but she was gone, and Alice began to remember that she was a Pawn, and that it would soon be time for her to move.\n",

    "\n",
    "Of course the first thing to do was to make a grand survey of the country she was going to travel through. Its something very like learning geography, thought Alice, as she stood on tiptoe in hopes of being able to see a little further. Principal riversthere are none. Principal mountainsIm on the only one, but I dont think its got any name. Principal townswhy, what are those creatures, making honey down there? They cant be beesnobody ever saw bees a mile off, you know and for some time she stood silent, watching one of them that was bustling about among the flowers, poking its proboscis into them, just as if it was a regular bee, thought Alice.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, this was anything but a regular bee: in fact it was an elephantas Alice soon found out, though the idea quite took her breath away at first. And what enormous flowers they must be! was her next idea. Something like cottages with the roofs taken off, and stalks put to themand what quantities of honey they must make! I think Ill go down andno, I wont just yet, she went on, checking herself just as she was beginning to run down the hill, and trying to find some excuse for turning shy so suddenly. Itll never do to go down among them without a good long branch to brush them awayand what fun itll be when they ask me how I like my walk. I shall sayOh, I like it well enough (here came the favourite little toss of the head), only it was so dusty and hot, and the elephants did tease so!\n",
    "\n",
    "I think Ill go down the other way, she said after a pause: and perhaps I may visit the elephants later on. Besides, I do so want to get into the Third Square!\n",

    "\n",

    "So young a child, said the gentleman sitting opposite to her (he was dressed in white paper), ought to know which way shes going, even if she doesnt know her own name!\n",

    "Alice couldnt see who was sitting beyond the Beetle, but a hoarse voice spoke next. Change engines it said, and was obliged to leave off.\n",
    "\n",
    "It sounds like a horse, Alice thought to herself. And an extremely small voice, close to her ear, said, You might make a joke on thatsomething about horse and hoarse, you know.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then a very gentle voice in the distance said, She must be labelled Lass, with care, you know\n",
    "\n",
    "And after that other voices went on (What a number of people there are in the carriage! thought Alice), saying, She must go by post, as shes got a head on her She must be sent as a message by the telegraph She must draw the train herself the rest of the way and so on.\n",

    "Indeed I shant! Alice said rather impatiently. I dont belong to this railway journey at allI was in a wood just nowand I wish I could get back there.\n",
    "\n",
    "You might make a joke on that, said the little voice close to her ear: something about you would if you could, you know.\n",
    "\n",
    "Dont tease so, said Alice, looking about in vain to see where the voice came from; if youre so anxious to have a joke made, why dont you make one yourself?\n",
    "\n",
    "The little voice sighed deeply: it was very unhappy, evidently, and Alice would have said something pitying to comfort it, If it would only sigh like other people! she thought. But this was such a wonderfully small sigh, that she wouldnt have heard it at all, if it hadnt come quite close to her ear. The consequence of this was that it tickled her ear very much, and quite took off her thoughts from the unhappiness of the poor little creature.\n",
    "\n",
    "I know you are a friend, the little voice went on; a dear friend, and an old friend. And you wont hurt me, though I am an insect.\n",
    "\n",
    "What kind of insect? Alice inquired a little anxiously. What she really wanted to know was, whether it could sting or not, but she thought this wouldnt be quite a civil question to ask.\n",
    "\n",
    "What, then you dont the little voice began, when it was drowned by a shrill scream from the engine, and everybody jumped up in alarm, Alice among the rest.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Horse, who had put his head out of the window, quietly drew it in and said, Its only a brook we have to jump over. Everybody seemed satisfied with this, though Alice felt a little nervous at the idea of trains jumping at all. However, itll take us into the Fourth Square, thats some comfort! she said to herself.

    "It certainly was a very large Gnat: about the size of a chicken, Alice thought. Still, she couldnt feel nervous with it, after they had been talking together so long.\n",

    "\n",
    "Of course they answer to their names? the Gnat remarked carelessly.\n",
    "\n",
    "I never knew them to do it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Whats the use of their having names, the Gnat said, if they wont answer to them?\n",
    "\n",
    "No use to them, said Alice; but its useful to the people who name them, I suppose. If not, why do things have names at all?\n",
    "\n",
    "I cant say, the Gnat replied. Further on, in the wood down there, theyve got no nameshowever, go on with your list of insects: youre wasting time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Well, theres the Horse-fly, Alice began, counting off the names on her fingers.\n",
    "\n",
    "All right, said the Gnat: half way up that bush, youll see a Rocking-horse-fly, if you look. Its made entirely of wood, and gets about by swinging itself from branch to branch.\n",
    "\n",
    "What does it live on? Alice asked, with great curiosity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sap and sawdust, said the Gnat. Go on with the list.\n",
    "\n",
    "Alice looked up at the Rocking-horse-fly with great interest, and made up her mind that it must have been just repainted, it looked so bright and sticky; and then she went on.\n",
    "\n",
    "And theres the Dragon-fly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Look on the branch above your head, said the Gnat, and there youll find a snap-dragon-fly. Its body is made of plum-pudding, its wings of holly-leaves, and its head is a raisin burning in brandy.\n",
    "\n",
    "And what does it live on?\n",
    "\n",
    "Frumenty and mince pie, the Gnat replied; and it makes its nest in a Christmas box.\n",
    "\n",
    "And then theres the Butterfly, Alice went on, after she had taken a good look at the insect with its head on fire, and had thought to herself, I wonder if thats the reason insects are so fond of flying into candlesbecause they want to turn into Snap-dragon-flies!\n",
    "\n",
    "Crawling at your feet, said the Gnat (Alice drew her feet back in some alarm), you may observe a Bread-and-Butterfly. Its wings are thin slices of Bread-and-butter, its body is a crust, and its head is a lump of sugar.\n",
    "\n",
    "And what does it live on?\n",
    "\n",
    "Weak tea with cream in it.\n",
    "\n",
    "A new difficulty came into Alices head. Supposing it couldnt find any? she suggested.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then it would die, of course.\n",
    "\n",
    "But that must happen very often, Alice remarked thoughtfully.\n",
    "\n",
    "It always happens, said the Gnat.\n",
    "\n",
    "After this, Alice was silent for a minute or two, pondering. The Gnat amused itself meanwhile by humming round and round her head: at last it settled again and remarked, I suppose you dont want to lose your name?\n",
    "\n",
    "No, indeed, Alice said, a little anxiously.\n",
    "\n",
    "And yet I dont know, the Gnat went on in a careless tone: only think how convenient it would be if you could manage to go home without it! For instance, if the governess wanted to call you to your lessons, she would call out come here, and there she would have to leave off, because there wouldnt be any name for her to call, and of course you wouldnt have to go, you know.\n",
    "\n",
    "That would never do, Im sure, said Alice: the governess would never think of excusing me lessons for that. If she couldnt remember my name, shed call me Miss! as the servants do.\n",
    "\n",
    "Well, if she said Miss, and didnt say anything more, the Gnat remarked, of course youd miss your lessons. Thats a joke. I wish you had made it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why do you wish I had made it? Alice asked. Its a very bad one.\n",
    "\n",
    "But the Gnat only sighed deeply, while two large tears came rolling down its cheeks.\n",
    "\n",
    "You shouldnt make jokes, Alice said, if it makes you so unhappy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then came another of those melancholy little sighs, and this time the poor Gnat really seemed to have sighed itself away, for, when Alice looked up, there was nothing whatever to be seen on the twig, and, as she was getting quite chilly with sitting still so long, she got up and walked on.\n",
    "\n",
    "She very soon came to an open field, with a wood on the other side of it: it looked much darker than the last wood, and Alice felt a little timid about going into it. However, on second thoughts, she made up her mind to go on: for I certainly wont go back, she thought to herself, and this was the only way to the Eighth Square.\n",
    "\n",
    "This must be the wood, she said thoughtfully to herself, where things have no names. I wonder whatll become of my name when I go in? I shouldnt like to lose it at allbecause theyd have to give me another, and it would be almost certain to be an ugly one. But then the fun would be trying to find the creature that had got my old name! Thats just like the advertisements, you know, when people lose dogsanswers to the name of Dash: had on a brass collarjust fancy calling everything you met Alice, till one of them answered! Only they wouldnt answer at all, if they were wise.\n",
    "\n",
    "She was rambling on in this way when she reached the wood: it looked very cool and shady. Well, at any rate its a great comfort, she said as she stepped under the trees, after being so hot, to get into theinto what? she went on, rather surprised at not being able to think of the word. I mean to get under theunder theunder this, you know! putting her hand on the trunk of the tree. What does it call itself, I wonder? I do believe its got no namewhy, to be sure it hasnt!\n",
    "\n",
    "She stood silent for a minute, thinking: then she suddenly began again. Then it really has happened, after all! And now, who am I? I will remember, if I can! Im determined to do it! But being determined didnt help much, and all she could say, after a great deal of puzzling, was, L, I know it begins with L!\n",
    "\n",
    "Just then a Fawn came wandering by: it looked at Alice with its large gentle eyes, but didnt seem at all frightened. Here then! Here then! Alice said, as she held out her hand and tried to stroke it; but it only started back a little, and then stood looking at her again.\n",
    "\n",
    "What do you call yourself? the Fawn said at last. Such a soft sweet voice it had!\n",
    "\n",
    "I wish I knew! thought poor Alice. She answered, rather sadly, Nothing, just now.\n",
    "\n",
    "Think again, it said: that wont do.\n",
    "\n",
    "Alice thought, but nothing came of it. Please, would you tell me what you call yourself? she said timidly. I think that might help a little.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ill tell you, if youll move a little further on, the Fawn said. I cant remember here.\n",
    "\n",
    "So they walked on together though the wood, Alice with her arms clasped lovingly round the soft neck of the Fawn, till they came out into another open field, and here the Fawn gave a sudden bound into the air, and shook itself free from Alices arms. Im a Fawn! it cried out in a voice of delight, and, dear me! youre a human child! A sudden look of alarm came into its beautiful brown eyes, and in another moment it had darted away at full speed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Alice stood looking after it, almost ready to cry with vexation at having lost her dear little fellow-traveller so suddenly. However, I know my name now. she said, thats some comfort. AliceAliceI wont forget it again. And now, which of these finger-posts ought I to follow, I wonder?\n",
    "\n",
    "It was not a very difficult question to answer, as there was only one road through the wood, and the two finger-posts both pointed along it. Ill settle it, Alice said to herself, when the road divides and they point different ways.\n",
    "\n",
    "But this did not seem likely to happen. She went on and on, a long way, but wherever the road divided there were sure to be two finger-posts pointing the same way, one marked TO TWEEDLEDUMS HOUSE and the other TO THE HOUSE OF TWEEDLEDEE.\n",
    "\n",
    "I do believe, said Alice at last, that they live in the same house! I wonder I never thought of that beforeBut I cant stay there long. Ill just call and say how dyou do? and ask them the way out of the wood. If I could only get to the Eighth Square before it gets dark! So she wandered on, talking to herself as she went, till, on turning a sharp corner, she came upon two fat little men, so suddenly that she could not help starting back, but in another moment she recovered herself, feeling sure that they must be.\n",

    "\n",
    "They were standing under a tree, each with an arm round the others neck, and Alice knew which was which in a moment, because one of them had DUM embroidered on his collar, and the other DEE. I suppose theyve each got TWEEDLE round at the back of the collar, she said to herself.\n",
    "\n",
    "They stood so still that she quite forgot they were alive, and she was just looking round to see if the word TWEEDLE was written at the back of each collar, when she was startled by a voice coming from the one marked DUM.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you think were wax-works, he said, you ought to pay, you know. Wax-works werent made to be looked at for nothing, nohow!\n",
    "\n",
    "Contrariwise, added the one marked DEE, if you think were alive, you ought to speak.\n",
    "\n",
    "Im sure Im very sorry, was all Alice could say; for the words of the old song kept ringing through her head like the ticking of a clock, and she could hardly help saying them out loud:\n",
    "\n",
    "     Tweedledum and Tweedledee\n",
    "      Agreed to have a battle;\n",
    "     For Tweedledum said Tweedledee\n",
    "      Had spoiled his nice new rattle.\n",
    "\n",
    "     Just then flew down a monstrous crow,\n",
    "      As black as a tar-barrel;\n",
    "     Which frightened both the heroes so,\n",
    "      They quite forgot their quarrel.\n",
    "\n",
    "I know what youre thinking about, said Tweedledum: but it isnt so, nohow.\n",
    "\n",
    "Contrariwise, continued Tweedledee, if it was so, it might be; and if it were so, it would be; but as it isnt, it aint. Thats logic.\n",
    "\n",
    "I was thinking, Alice said very politely, which is the best way out of this wood: its getting so dark. Would you tell me, please?\n",
    "\n",
    "But the little men only looked at each other and grinned.\n",
    "\n",
    "They looked so exactly like a couple of great schoolboys, that Alice couldnt help pointing her finger at Tweedledum, and saying First Boy!\n",
    "\n",
    "Nohow! Tweedledum cried out briskly, and shut his mouth up again with a snap.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next Boy! said Alice, passing on to Tweedledee, though she felt quite certain he would only shout out Contrariwise! and so he did.\n",
    "\n",
    "Youve been wrong! cried Tweedledum. The first thing in a visit is to say How dye do? and shake hands! And here the two brothers gave each other a hug, and then they held out the two hands that were free, to shake hands with her.\n",
    "\n",
    "Alice did not like shaking hands with either of them first, for fear of hurting the other ones feelings; so, as the best way out of the difficulty, she took hold of both hands at once: the next moment they were dancing round in a ring. This seemed quite natural (she remembered afterwards), and she was not even surprised to hear music playing: it seemed to come from the tree under which they were dancing, and it was done (as well as she could make it out) by the branches rubbing one across the other, like fiddles and fiddle-sticks.\n",
    "\n",
    "But it certainly was funny, (Alice said afterwards, when she was telling her sister the history of all this,) to find myself singing Here we go round the mulberry bush. I dont know when I began it, but somehow I felt as if Id been singing it a long long time!\n",
    "\n",
    "The other two dancers were fat, and very soon out of breath. Four times round is enough for one dance, Tweedledum panted out, and they left off dancing as suddenly as they had begun: the music stopped at the same moment.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then they let go of Alices hands, and stood looking at her for a minute: there was a rather awkward pause, as Alice didnt know how to begin a conversation with people she had just been dancing with. It would never do to say How dye do? now, she said to herself: we seem to have got beyond that, somehow!\n",
    "\n",
    "I hope youre not much tired? she said at last.\n",
    "\n",
    "Nohow. And thank you very much for asking, said Tweedledum.\n",
    "\n",
    "So much obliged! added Tweedledee. You like poetry?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ye-es, pretty wellsome poetry, Alice said doubtfully. Would you tell me which road leads out of the wood?\n",
    "\n",
    "What shall I repeat to her? said Tweedledee, looking round at Tweedledum with great solemn eyes, and not noticing Alices question.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Walrus and the Carpenter is the longest, Tweedledum replied, giving his brother an affectionate hug.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tweedledee began instantly:\n",
    "\n",
    "       The sun was shining\n",
    "\n",
    "Here Alice ventured to interrupt him. If its very long, she said, as politely as she could, would you please tell me first which road\n",
    "\n",
    "Tweedledee smiled gently, and began again:\n",
    "\n",
    "     The sun was shining on the sea,\n",
    "      Shining with all his might:\n",
    "     He did his very best to make\n",

    "     And this was odd, because it was\n",
    "      The middle of the night.\n",

    "     The moon was shining sulkily,\n",
    "      Because she thought the sun\n",
    "     Had got no business to be there\n",
    "      After the day was done\n",
    "     Its very rude of him, she said,\n",
    "      To come and spoil the fun!\n",
    "\n",
    "     The sea was wet as wet could be,\n",
    "      The sands were dry as dry.\n",

    "     Do you suppose, the Walrus said,\n",
    "      That they could get it clear?\n",
    "      I doubt it, said the Carpenter,\n",
    "      And shed a bitter tear.\n",
    "\n",
    "     O Oysters, come and walk with us!\n",
    "       The Walrus did beseech.\n",
    "     A pleasant walk, a pleasant talk,\n",
    "      Along the briny beach:\n",
    "     We cannot do with more than four,\n",
    "      To give a hand to each.\n",
    "\n",
    "     The eldest Oyster looked at him.\n",
    "      But never a word he said:\n",
    "     The eldest Oyster winked his eye,\n",
    "      And shook his heavy head\n",
    "     Meaning to say he did not choose\n",
    "      To leave the oyster-bed.\n",
    "\n",
    "     But four young oysters hurried up,\n",
    "      All eager for the treat:\n",
    "     Their coats were brushed, their faces washed,\n",
    "      Their shoes were clean and neat\n",

    "\n",
    "     Four other Oysters followed them,\n",
    "      And yet another four;\n",
    "     And thick and fast they came at last,\n",
    "      And more, and more, and more\n",
    "     All hopping through the frothy waves,\n",
    "      And scrambling to the shore.\n",
    "\n",
    "     The Walrus and the Carpenter\n",
    "      Walked on a mile or so,\n",
    "     And then they rested on a rock\n",
    "      Conveniently low:\n",
    "     And all the little Oysters stood\n",
    "      And waited in a row.\n",
    "\n",
    "     The time has come, the Walrus said,\n",
    "      To talk of many things:\n",
    "     Of shoesand shipsand sealing-wax\n",
    "      Of cabbagesand kings\n",
    "     And why the sea is boiling hot\n",
    "      And whether pigs have wings.\n",
    "\n",
    "     But wait a bit, the Oysters cried,\n",
    "      Before we have our chat;\n",
    "     For some of us are out of breath,\n",
    "      And all of us are fat!\n",
    "      No hurry! said the Carpenter.\n",
    "      They thanked him much for that.\n",
    "\n",
    "     A loaf of bread, the Walrus said,\n",
    "      Is what we chiefly need:\n",
    "     Pepper and vinegar besides\n",
    "      Are very good indeed\n",
    "     Now if youre ready Oysters dear,\n",
    "      We can begin to feed.\n",
    "\n",
    "     But not on us! the Oysters cried,\n",
    "      Turning a little blue,\n",
    "     After such kindness, that would be\n",
    "      A dismal thing to do!\n",
    "      The night is fine, the Walrus said\n",
    "      Do you admire the view?\n",
    "\n",
    "     It was so kind of you to come!\n",
    "      And you are very nice!\n",

    "     I wish you were not quite so deaf\n",
    "      Ive had to ask you twice!\n",
    "\n",
    "     It seems a shame, the Walrus said,\n",
    "      To play them such a trick,\n",
    "     After weve brought them out so far,\n",
    "      And made them trot so quick!\n",
    "      The Carpenter said nothing but\n",
    "      The butters spread too thick!\n",
    "\n",
    "     I weep for you, the Walrus said.\n",
    "      I deeply sympathize.\n",
    "      With sobs and tears he sorted out\n",
    "      Those of the largest size.\n",
    "     Holding his pocket handkerchief\n",
    "      Before his streaming eyes.\n",
    "\n",
    "     O Oysters, said the Carpenter.\n",
    "      Youve had a pleasant run!\n",
    "     Shall we be trotting home again?\n",
    "       But answer came there none\n",
    "     And that was scarcely odd, because\n",
    "      Theyd eaten every one.\n",
    "\n",
    "I like the Walrus best, said Alice: because you see he was a little sorry for the poor oysters.\n",
    "\n",
    "He ate more than the Carpenter, though, said Tweedledee. You see he held his handkerchief in front, so that the Carpenter couldnt count how many he took: contrariwise.\n",
    "\n",
    "That was mean! Alice said indignantly. Then I like the Carpenter bestif he didnt eat so many as the Walrus.\n",
    "\n",
    "But he ate as many as he could get, said Tweedledum.\n",
    "\n",
    "This was a puzzler. After a pause, Alice began, Well! They were both very unpleasant characters Here she checked herself in some alarm, at hearing something that sounded to her like the puffing of a large steam-engine in the wood near them, though she feared it was more likely to be a wild beast. Are there any lions or tigers about here? she asked timidly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Its only the Red King snoring, said Tweedledee.\n",
    "\n",
    "Come and look at him! the brothers cried, and they each took one of Alices hands, and led her up to where the King was sleeping.\n",
    "\n",
    "Isnt he a lovely sight? said Tweedledum.\n",
    "\n",
    "Alice couldnt say honestly that he was. He had a tall red night-cap on, with a tassel, and he was lying crumpled up into a sort of untidy heap, and snoring loudfit to snore his head off! as Tweedledum remarked.\n",
    "\n",
    "Im afraid hell catch cold with lying on the damp grass, said Alice, who was a very thoughtful little girl.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hes dreaming now, said Tweedledee: and what do you think hes dreaming about?\n",
    "\n",
    "Alice said Nobody can guess that.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why, about you! Tweedledee exclaimed, clapping his hands triumphantly. And if he left off dreaming about you, where do you suppose youd be?\n",
    "\n",
    "Where I am now, of course, said Alice.\n",
    "\n",
    "Not you! Tweedledee retorted contemptuously. Youd be nowhere. Why, youre only a sort of thing in his dream!\n",
    "\n",
    "If that there King was to wake, added Tweedledum, youd go outbang!just like a candle!\n",
    "\n",
    "I shouldnt! Alice exclaimed indignantly. Besides, if Im only a sort of thing in his dream, what are you, I should like to know?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ditto said Tweedledum.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ditto, ditto cried Tweedledee.\n",
    "\n",
    "He shouted this so loud that Alice couldnt help saying, Hush! Youll be waking him, Im afraid, if you make so much noise.\n",
    "\n",
    "Well, it no use your talking about waking him, said Tweedledum, when youre only one of the things in his dream. You know very well youre not real.\n",
    "\n",
    "I am real! said Alice and began to cry.\n",
    "\n",
    "You wont make yourself a bit realler by crying, Tweedledee remarked: theres nothing to cry about.\n",
    "\n",
    "If I wasnt real, Alice saidhalf-laughing through her tears, it all seemed so ridiculousI shouldnt be able to cry.\n",
    "\n",
    "I hope you dont suppose those are real tears? Tweedledum interrupted in a tone of great contempt.\n",
    "\n",
    "I know theyre talking nonsense, Alice thought to herself: and its foolish to cry about it. So she brushed away her tears, and went on as cheerfully as she could. At any rate Id better be getting out of the wood, for really its coming on very dark. Do you think its going to rain?\n",
    "\n",
    "Tweedledum spread a large umbrella over himself and his brother, and looked up into it. No, I dont think it is, he said: at leastnot under here. Nohow.\n",
    "\n",
    "But it may rain outside?\n",
    "\n",
    "It mayif it chooses, said Tweedledee: weve no objection. Contrariwise.\n",
    "\n",
    "Selfish things! thought Alice, and she was just going to say Good-night and leave them, when Tweedledum sprang out from under the umbrella and seized her by the wrist.\n",
    "\n",
    "Do you see that? he said, in a voice choking with passion, and his eyes grew large and yellow all in a moment, as he pointed with a trembling finger at a small white thing lying under the tree.\n",
    "\n",
    "Its only a rattle, Alice said, after a careful examination of the little white thing. Not a rattle-snake, you know, she added hastily, thinking that he was frightened: only an old rattlequite old and broken.\n",
    "\n",
    "I knew it was! cried Tweedledum, beginning to stamp about wildly and tear his hair. Its spoilt, of course! Here he looked at Tweedledee, who immediately sat down on the ground, and tried to hide himself under the umbrella.\n",
    "\n",
    "Alice laid her hand upon his arm, and said in a soothing tone, You neednt be so angry about an old rattle.\n",
    "\n",
    "But it isnt old! Tweedledum cried, in a greater fury than ever. Its new, I tell youI bought it yesterdaymy nice new RATTLE! and his voice rose to a perfect scream.\n",
    "\n",
    "All this time Tweedledee was trying his best to fold up the umbrella, with himself in it: which was such an extraordinary thing to do, that it quite took off Alices attention from the angry brother. But he couldnt quite succeed, and it ended in his rolling over, bundled up in the umbrella, with only his head out: and there he lay, opening and shutting his mouth and his large eyeslooking more like a fish than anything else, Alice thought.\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course you agree to have a battle? Tweedledum said in a calmer tone.\n",
    "\n",
    "I suppose so, the other sulkily replied, as he crawled out of the umbrella: only she must help us to dress up, you know.\n",
    "\n",
    "So the two brothers went off hand-in-hand into the wood, and returned in a minute with their arms full of thingssuch as bolsters, blankets, hearth-rugs, table-cloths, dish-covers and coal-scuttles. I hope youre a good hand at pinning and tying strings? Tweedledum remarked. Every one of these things has got to go on, somehow or other.\n",
    "\n",
    "Alice said afterwards she had never seen such a fuss made about anything in all her lifethe way those two bustled aboutand the quantity of things they put onand the trouble they gave her in tying strings and fastening buttonsReally theyll be more like bundles of old clothes than anything else, by the time theyre ready! she said to herself, as she arranged a bolster round the neck of Tweedledee, to keep his head from being cut off, as he said.\n",
    "\n",
    "You know, he added very gravely, its one of the most serious things that can possibly happen to one in a battleto get ones head cut off.\n",
    "\n",
    "Alice laughed aloud: but she managed to turn it into a cough, for fear of hurting his feelings.\n",
    "\n",
    "Do I look very pale? said Tweedledum, coming up to have his helmet tied on. (He called it a helmet, though it certainly looked much more like a saucepan.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Wellyesa little, Alice replied gently.\n",
    "\n",
    "Im very brave generally, he went on in a low voice: only to-day I happen to have a headache.\n",
    "\n",
    "And Ive got a toothache! said Tweedledee, who had overheard the remark. Im far worse off than you!\n",
    "\n",
    "Then youd better not fight to-day, said Alice, thinking it a good opportunity to make peace.\n",
    "\n",
    "We must have a bit of a fight, but I dont care about going on long, said Tweedledum. Whats the time now?\n",
    "\n",
    "Tweedledee looked at his watch, and said Half-past four.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lets fight till six, and then have dinner, said Tweedledum.\n",
    "\n",
    "Very well, the other said, rather sadly: and she can watch usonly youd better not come very close, he added: I generally hit everything I can seewhen I get really excited.\n",
    "\n",
    "And I hit everything within reach, cried Tweedledum, whether I can see it or not!\n",
    "\n",
    "Alice laughed. You must hit the trees pretty often, I should think, she said.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tweedledum looked round him with a satisfied smile. I dont suppose, he said, therell be a tree left standing, for ever so far round, by the time weve finished!\n",
    "\n",
    "And all about a rattle! said Alice, still hoping to make them a little ashamed of fighting for such a trifle.\n",
    "\n",
    "I shouldnt have minded it so much, said Tweedledum, if it hadnt been a new one.\n",
    "\n",
    "I wish the monstrous crow would come! thought Alice.\n",
    "\n",
    "Theres only one sword, you know, Tweedledum said to his brother: but you can have the umbrellaits quite as sharp. Only we must begin quick. Its getting as dark as it can.\n",
    "\n",
    "And darker, said Tweedledee.\n",
    "\n",
    "It was getting dark so suddenly that Alice thought there must be a thunderstorm coming on. What a thick black cloud that is! she said. And how fast it comes! Why, I do believe its got wings!\n",
    "\n",
    "Its the crow! Tweedledum cried out in a shrill voice of alarm: and the two brothers took to their heels and were out of sight in a moment.\n",
    "\n",
    "Alice ran a little way into the wood, and stopped under a large tree. It can never get at me here, she thought: its far too large to squeeze itself in among the trees. But I wish it wouldnt flap its wings soit makes quite a hurricane in the woodheres somebodys shawl being blown away!\n",

    "\n",
    "She caught the shawl as she spoke, and looked about for the owner: in another moment the White Queen came running wildly through the wood, with both arms stretched out wide, as if she were flying, and Alice very civilly went to meet her with the shawl.\n",
    "\n",
    "Im very glad I happened to be in the way, Alice said, as she helped her to put on her shawl again.\n",
    "\n",
    "The White Queen only looked at her in a helpless frightened sort of way, and kept repeating something in a whisper to herself that sounded like bread-and-butter, bread-and-butter, and Alice felt that if there was to be any conversation at all, she must manage it herself. So she began rather timidly: Am I addressing the White Queen?\n",
    "\n",
    "Well, yes, if you call that a-dressing, The Queen said. It isnt my notion of the thing, at all.\n",
    "\n",
    "Alice thought it would never do to have an argument at the very beginning of their conversation, so she smiled and said, If your Majesty will only tell me the right way to begin, Ill do it as well as I can.\n",
    "\n",
    "But I dont want it done at all! groaned the poor Queen. Ive been a-dressing myself for the last two hours.\n",
    "\n",
    "It would have been all the better, as it seemed to Alice, if she had got some one else to dress her, she was so dreadfully untidy. Every single things crooked, Alice thought to herself, and shes all over pins!may I put your shawl straight for you? she added aloud.\n",
    "\n",
    "I dont know whats the matter with it! the Queen said, in a melancholy voice. Its out of temper, I think. Ive pinned it here, and Ive pinned it there, but theres no pleasing it!\n",
    "\n",
    "It cant go straight, you know, if you pin it all on one side, Alice said, as she gently put it right for her; and, dear me, what a state your hair is in!\n",
    "\n",
    "The brush has got entangled in it! the Queen said with a sigh. And I lost the comb yesterday.\n",
    "\n",
    "Alice carefully released the brush, and did her best to get the hair into order. Come, you look rather better now! she said, after altering most of the pins. But really you should have a ladys maid!\n",
    "\n",
    "Im sure Ill take you with pleasure! the Queen said. Twopence a week, and jam every other day.\n",
    "\n",
    "Alice couldnt help laughing, as she said, I dont want you to hire meand I dont care for jam.\n",
    "\n",
    "Its very good jam, said the Queen.\n",
    "\n",
    "Well, I dont want any to-day, at any rate.\n",
    "\n",
    "You couldnt have it if you did want it, the Queen said. The rule is, jam to-morrow and jam yesterdaybut never jam to-day.\n",
    "\n",
    "It must come sometimes to jam to-day, Alice objected.\n",
    "\n",
    "No, it cant, said the Queen. Its jam every other day: to-day isnt any other day, you know.\n",
    "\n",
    "I dont understand you, said Alice. Its dreadfully confusing!\n",
    "\n",
    "Thats the effect of living backwards, the Queen said kindly: it always makes one a little giddy at first\n",
    "\n",
    "Living backwards! Alice repeated in great astonishment. I never heard of such a thing!\n",
    "\n",
    "but theres one great advantage in it, that ones memory works both ways.\n",
    "\n",
    "Im sure mine only works one way, Alice remarked. I cant remember things before they happen.\n",
    "\n",
    "Its a poor sort of memory that only works backwards, the Queen remarked.\n",
    "\n",
    "What sort of things do you remember best? Alice ventured to ask.\n",
    "\n",
    "Oh, things that happened the week after next, the Queen replied in a careless tone. For instance, now, she went on, sticking a large piece of plaster on her finger as she spoke, theres the Kings Messenger. Hes in prison now, being punished: and the trial doesnt even begin till next Wednesday: and of course the crime comes last of all.\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose he never commits the crime? said Alice.\n",
    "\n",
    "That would be all the better, wouldnt it? the Queen said, as she bound the plaster round her finger with a bit of ribbon.\n",
    "\n",
    "Alice felt there was no denying that. Of course it would be all the better, she said: but it wouldnt be all the better his being punished.\n",
    "\n",
    "Youre wrong there, at any rate, said the Queen: were you ever punished?\n",
    "\n",
    "Only for faults, said Alice.\n",
    "\n",
    "And you were all the better for it, I know! the Queen said triumphantly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Yes, but then I had done the things I was punished for, said Alice: that makes all the difference.\n",
    "\n",
    "But if you hadnt done them, the Queen said, that would have been better still; better, and better, and better! Her voice went higher with each better, till it got quite to a squeak at last.\n",
    "\n",
    "Alice was just beginning to say Theres a mistake somewhere, when the Queen began screaming so loud that she had to leave the sentence unfinished. Oh, oh, oh! shouted the Queen, shaking her hand about as if she wanted to shake it off. My fingers bleeding! Oh, oh, oh, oh!\n",
    "\n",
    "Her screams were so exactly like the whistle of a steam-engine, that Alice had to hold both her hands over her ears.\n",
    "\n",
    "What is the matter? she said, as soon as there was a chance of making herself heard. Have you pricked your finger?\n",
    "\n",
    "I havent pricked it yet, the Queen said, but I soon shalloh, oh, oh!\n",
    "\n",
    "When do you expect to do it? Alice asked, feeling very much inclined to laugh.\n",
    "\n",
    "When I fasten my shawl again, the poor Queen groaned out: the brooch will come undone directly. Oh, oh! As she said the words the brooch flew open, and the Queen clutched wildly at it, and tried to clasp it again.\n",
    "\n",
    "Take care! cried Alice. Youre holding it all crooked! And she caught at the brooch; but it was too late: the pin had slipped, and the Queen had pricked her finger.\n",
    "\n",
    "That accounts for the bleeding, you see, she said to Alice with a smile. Now you understand the way things happen here.\n",
    "\n",
    "But why dont you scream now? Alice asked, holding her hands ready to put over her ears again.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why, Ive done all the screaming already, said the Queen. What would be the good of having it all over again?\n",
    "\n",
    "By this time it was getting light. The crow must have flown away, I think, said Alice: Im so glad its gone. I thought it was the night coming on.\n",
    "\n",
    "I wish I could manage to be glad! the Queen said. Only I never can remember the rule. You must be very happy, living in this wood, and being glad whenever you like!\n",
    "\n",
    "Only it is so very lonely here! Alice said in a melancholy voice; and at the thought of her loneliness two large tears came rolling down her cheeks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Oh, dont go on like that! cried the poor Queen, wringing her hands in despair. Consider what a great girl you are. Consider what a long way youve come to-day. Consider what oclock it is. Consider anything, only dont cry!\n",
    "\n",
    "Alice could not help laughing at this, even in the midst of her tears. Can you keep from crying by considering things? she asked.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thats the way its done, the Queen said with great decision: nobody can do two things at once, you know. Lets consider your age to begin withhow old are you?\n",
    "\n",
    "Im seven and a half exactly.\n",
    "\n",
    "You neednt say exactually, the Queen remarked: I can believe it without that. Now Ill give you something to believe. Im just one hundred and one, five months and a day.\n",
    "\n",
    "I cant believe that! said Alice.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cant you? the Queen said in a pitying tone. Try again: draw a long breath, and shut your eyes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Alice laughed. Theres no use trying, she said: one cant believe impossible things.\n",
    "\n",
    "I daresay you havent had much practice, said the Queen. When I was your age, I always did it for half-an-hour a day. Why, sometimes Ive believed as many as six impossible things before breakfast. There goes the shawl again!\n",
    "\n",
    "The brooch had come undone as she spoke, and a sudden gust of wind blew the Queens shawl across a little brook. The Queen spread out her arms again, and went flying after it, and this time she succeeded in catching it for herself. Ive got it! she cried in a triumphant tone. Now you shall see me pin it on again, all by myself!\n",
    "\n",
    "Then I hope your finger is better now? Alice said very politely, as she crossed the little brook after the Queen.\n",

    "Oh, much better! cried the Queen, her voice rising to a squeak as she went on. Much be-etter! Be-etter! Be-e-e-etter! Be-e-ehh! The last word ended in a long bleat, so like a sheep that Alice quite started.\n",
    "\n",
    "She looked at the Queen, who seemed to have suddenly wrapped herself up in wool. Alice rubbed her eyes, and looked again. She couldnt make out what had happened at all. Was she in a shop? And was that reallywas it really a sheep that was sitting on the other side of the counter? Rub as she could, she could make nothing more of it: she was in a little dark shop, leaning with her elbows on the counter, and opposite to her was an old Sheep, sitting in an arm-chair knitting, and every now and then leaving off to look at her through a great pair of spectacles.\n",
    "\n",
    "What is it you want to buy? the Sheep said at last, looking up for a moment from her knitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "I dont quite know yet, Alice said, very gently. I should like to look all round me first, if I might.\n",
    "\n",
    "You may look in front of you, and on both sides, if you like, said the Sheep: but you cant look all round youunless youve got eyes at the back of your head.\n",
    "\n",
    "But these, as it happened, Alice had not got: so she contented herself with turning round, looking at the shelves as she came to them.\n",
    "\n",
    "The shop seemed to be full of all manner of curious thingsbut the oddest part of it all was, that whenever she looked hard at any shelf, to make out exactly what it had on it, that particular shelf was always quite empty: though the others round it were crowded as full as they could hold.\n",
    "\n",
    "Things flow about so here! she said at last in a plaintive tone, after she had spent a minute or so in vainly pursuing a large bright thing, that looked sometimes like a doll and sometimes like a work-box, and was always in the shelf next above the one she was looking at. And this one is the most provoking of allbut Ill tell you what she added, as a sudden thought struck her, Ill follow it up to the very top shelf of all. Itll puzzle it to go through the ceiling, I expect!\n",
    "\n",
    "But even this plan failed: the thing went through the ceiling as quietly as possible, as if it were quite used to it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Are you a child or a teetotum? the Sheep said, as she took up another pair of needles. Youll make me giddy soon, if you go on turning round like that. She was now working with fourteen pairs at once, and Alice couldnt help looking at her in great astonishment.\n",
    "\n",
    "How can she knit with so many? the puzzled child thought to herself. She gets more and more like a porcupine every minute!\n",
    "\n",
    "Can you row? the Sheep asked, handing her a pair of knitting-needles as she spoke.\n",
    "\n",
    "Yes, a littlebut not on landand not with needles Alice was beginning to say, when suddenly the needles turned into oars in her hands, and she found they were in a little boat, gliding along between banks: so there was nothing for it but to do her best.\n",
    "\n",
    "Feather! cried the Sheep, as she took up another pair of needles.\n",
    "\n",
    "This didnt sound like a remark that needed any answer, so Alice said nothing, but pulled away. There was something very queer about the water, she thought, as every now and then the oars got fast in it, and would hardly come out again.\n",
    "\n",
    "Feather! Feather! the Sheep cried again, taking more needles. Youll be catching a crab directly.\n",
    "\n",
    "A dear little crab! thought Alice. I should like that.\n",
    "\n",
    "Didnt you hear me say Feather? the Sheep cried angrily, taking up quite a bunch of needles.\n",
    "\n",
    "Indeed I did, said Alice: youve said it very oftenand very loud. Please, where are the crabs?\n",
    "\n",
    "In the water, of course! said the Sheep, sticking some of the needles into her hair, as her hands were full. Feather, I say!\n",
    "\n",
    "Why do you say feather so often? Alice asked at last, rather vexed. Im not a bird!\n",
    "\n",
    "You are, said the Sheep: youre a little goose.\n",
    "\n",
    "This offended Alice a little, so there was no more conversation for a minute or two, while the boat glided gently on, sometimes among beds of weeds (which made the oars stick fast in the water, worse then ever), and sometimes under trees, but always with the same tall river-banks frowning over their heads.\n",
    "\n",
    "Oh, please! There are some scented rushes! Alice cried in a sudden transport of delight. There really areand such beauties!\n",
    "\n",
    "You neednt say please to me about em, the Sheep said, without looking up from her knitting: I didnt put em there, and Im not going to take em away.\n",
    "\n",
    "No, but I meantplease, may we wait and pick some? Alice pleaded. If you dont mind stopping the boat for a minute.\n",
    "\n",
    "How am I to stop it? said the Sheep. If you leave off rowing, itll stop of itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "So the boat was left to drift down the stream as it would, till it glided gently in among the waving rushes. And then the little sleeves were carefully rolled up, and the little arms were plunged in elbow-deep to get the rushes a good long way down before breaking them offand for a while Alice forgot all about the Sheep and the knitting, as she bent over the side of the boat, with just the ends of her tangled hair dipping into the waterwhile with bright eager eyes she caught at one bunch after another of the darling scented rushes.\n",
    "\n",
    "I only hope the boat wont tipple over! she said to herself. Oh, what a lovely one! Only I couldnt quite reach it. And it certainly did seem a little provoking (almost as if it happened on purpose, she thought) that, though she managed to pick plenty of beautiful rushes as the boat glided by, there was always a more lovely one that she couldnt reach.\n",
    "\n",
    "The prettiest are always further! she said at last, with a sigh at the obstinacy of the rushes in growing so far off, as, with flushed cheeks and dripping hair and hands, she scrambled back into her place, and began to arrange her new-found treasures.\n",
    "\n",
    "What mattered it to her just then that the rushes had begun to fade, and to lose all their scent and beauty, from the very moment that she picked them? Even real scented rushes, you know, last only a very little whileand these, being dream-rushes, melted away almost like snow, as they lay in heaps at her feetbut Alice hardly noticed this, there were so many other curious things to think about.\n",
    "\n",
    "They hadnt gone much farther before the blade of one of the oars got fast in the water and wouldnt come out again (so Alice explained it afterwards), and the consequence was that the handle of it caught her under the chin, and, in spite of a series of little shrieks of Oh, oh, oh! from poor Alice, it swept her straight off the seat, and down among the heap of rushes.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, she wasnt hurt, and was soon up again: the Sheep went on with her knitting all the while, just as if nothing had happened. That was a nice crab you caught! she remarked, as Alice got back into her place, very much relieved to find herself still in the boat.\n",
    "\n",
    "Was it? I didnt see it, Said Alice, peeping cautiously over the side of the boat into the dark water. I wish it hadnt let goI should so like to see a little crab to take home with me! But the Sheep only laughed scornfully, and went on with her knitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "Are there many crabs here? said Alice.\n",
    "\n",
    "Crabs, and all sorts of things, said the Sheep: plenty of choice, only make up your mind. Now, what do you want to buy?\n",
    "\n",
    "To buy! Alice echoed in a tone that was half astonished and half frightenedfor the oars, and the boat, and the river, had vanished all in a moment, and she was back again in the little dark shop.\n",
    "\n",
    "I should like to buy an egg, please, she said timidly. How do you sell them?\n",
    "\n",
    "Fivepence farthing for oneTwopence for two, the Sheep replied.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then two are cheaper than one? Alice said in a surprised tone, taking out her purse.\n",
    "\n",
    "Only you must eat them both, if you buy two, said the Sheep.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then Ill have one, please, said Alice, as she put the money down on the counter. For she thought to herself, They mightnt be at all nice, you know.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Sheep took the money, and put it away in a box: then she said I never put things into peoples handsthat would never doyou must get it for yourself. And so saying, she went off to the other end of the shop, and set the egg upright on a shelf.\n",
    "\n",
    "I wonder why it wouldnt do? thought Alice, as she groped her way among the tables and chairs, for the shop was very dark towards the end. The egg seems to get further away the more I walk towards it. Let me see, is this a chair? Why, its got branches, I declare! How very odd to find trees growing here! And actually heres a little brook! Well, this is the very queerest shop I ever saw!\n",
    "\n",
    "  *    *    *    *    *    *    *\n",

    "\n",
    "  *    *    *    *    *    *    *\n",
    "\n",
    "So she went on, wondering more and more at every step, as everything turned into a tree the moment she came up to it, and she quite expected the egg to do the same.\n",

    "However, the egg only got larger and larger, and more and more human: when she had come within a few yards of it, she saw that it had eyes and a nose and mouth; and when she had come close to it, she saw clearly that it was HUMPTY DUMPTY himself. It cant be anybody else! she said to herself. Im as certain of it, as if his name were written all over his face.\n",
    "\n",
    "It might have been written a hundred times, easily, on that enormous face. Humpty Dumpty was sitting with his legs crossed, like a Turk, on the top of a high wallsuch a narrow one that Alice quite wondered how he could keep his balanceand, as his eyes were steadily fixed in the opposite direction, and he didnt take the least notice of her, she thought he must be a stuffed figure after all.\n",
    "\n",
    "And how exactly like an egg he is! she said aloud, standing with her hands ready to catch him, for she was every moment expecting him to fall.\n",
    "\n",
    "Its very provoking, Humpty Dumpty said after a long silence, looking away from Alice as he spoke, to be called an eggVery!\n",
    "\n",
    "I said you looked like an egg, Sir, Alice gently explained. And some eggs are very pretty, you know she added, hoping to turn her remark into a sort of a compliment.\n",

    "     Humpty Dumpty had a great fall.\n",

    "Dont stand there chattering to yourself like that, Humpty Dumpty said, looking at her for the first time, but tell me your name and your business.\n",
    "\n",
    "My name is Alice, but\n",
    "\n",
    "Its a stupid enough name! Humpty Dumpty interrupted impatiently. What does it mean?\n",
    "\n",
    "Must a name mean something? Alice asked doubtfully.\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course it must, Humpty Dumpty said with a short laugh: my name means the shape I amand a good handsome shape it is, too. With a name like yours, you might be any shape, almost.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why do you sit out here all alone? said Alice, not wishing to begin an argument.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why, because theres nobody with me! cried Humpty Dumpty. Did you think I didnt know the answer to that? Ask another.\n",
    "\n",
    "Dont you think youd be safer down on the ground? Alice went on, not with any idea of making another riddle, but simply in her good-natured anxiety for the queer creature. That wall is so very narrow!\n",
    "\n",
    "What tremendously easy riddles you ask! Humpty Dumpty growled out. Of course I dont think so! Why, if ever I did fall offwhich theres no chance ofbut if I did Here he pursed his lips and looked so solemn and grand that Alice could hardly help laughing. If I did fall, he went on, The King has promised mewith his very own mouthtoto\n",

    "Now I declare thats too bad! Humpty Dumpty cried, breaking into a sudden passion. Youve been listening at doorsand behind treesand down chimneysor you couldnt have known it!\n",
    "\n",
    "I havent, indeed! Alice said very gently. Its in a book.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ah, well! They may write such things in a book, Humpty Dumpty said in a calmer tone. Thats what you call a History of England, that is. Now, take a good look at me! Im one that has spoken to a King, I am: mayhap youll never see such another: and to show you Im not proud, you may shake hands with me! And he grinned almost from ear to ear, as he leant forwards (and as nearly as possible fell off the wall in doing so) and offered Alice his hand. She watched him a little anxiously as she took it. If he smiled much more, the ends of his mouth might meet behind, she thought: and then I dont know what would happen to his head! Im afraid it would come off!\n",
    "\n",
    "Yes, all his horses and all his men, Humpty Dumpty went on. Theyd pick me up again in a minute, they would! However, this conversation is going on a little too fast: lets go back to the last remark but one.\n",
    "\n",
    "Im afraid I cant quite remember it, Alice said very politely.\n",
    "\n",
    "In that case we start fresh, said Humpty Dumpty, and its my turn to choose a subject (He talks about it just as if it was a game! thought Alice.) So heres a question for you. How old did you say you were?\n",
    "\n",
    "Alice made a short calculation, and said Seven years and six months.\n",
    "\n",
    "Wrong! Humpty Dumpty exclaimed triumphantly. You never said a word like it!\n",
    "\n",
    "I though you meant How old are you? Alice explained.\n",
    "\n",
    "If Id meant that, Id have said it, said Humpty Dumpty.\n",
    "\n",
    "Alice didnt want to begin another argument, so she said nothing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Seven years and six months! Humpty Dumpty repeated thoughtfully. An uncomfortable sort of age. Now if youd asked my advice, Id have said Leave off at sevenbut its too late now.\n",
    "\n",
    "I never ask advice about growing, Alice said indignantly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Too proud? the other inquired.\n",
    "\n",
    "Alice felt even more indignant at this suggestion. I mean, she said, that one cant help growing older.\n",
    "\n",
    "One cant, perhaps, said Humpty Dumpty, but two can. With proper assistance, you might have left off at seven.\n",
    "\n",
    "What a beautiful belt youve got on! Alice suddenly remarked.\n",
    "\n",
    "(They had had quite enough of the subject of age, she thought: and if they really were to take turns in choosing subjects, it was her turn now.) At least, she corrected herself on second thoughts, a beautiful cravat, I should have saidno, a belt, I meanI beg your pardon! she added in dismay, for Humpty Dumpty looked thoroughly offended, and she began to wish she hadnt chosen that subject. If I only knew, she thought to herself, which was neck and which was waist!\n",
    "\n",
    "Evidently Humpty Dumpty was very angry, though he said nothing for a minute or two. When he did speak again, it was in a deep growl.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is amostprovokingthing, he said at last, when a person doesnt know a cravat from a belt!\n",
    "\n",
    "I know its very ignorant of me, Alice said, in so humble a tone that Humpty Dumpty relented.\n",
    "\n",
    "Its a cravat, child, and a beautiful one, as you say. Its a present from the White King and Queen. There now!\n",
    "\n",
    "Is it really? said Alice, quite pleased to find that she had chosen a good subject, after all.\n",
    "\n",
    "They gave it me, Humpty Dumpty continued thoughtfully, as he crossed one knee over the other and clasped his hands round it, they gave it mefor an un-birthday present.\n",
    "\n",
    "I beg your pardon? Alice said with a puzzled air.\n",
    "\n",
    "Im not offended, said Humpty Dumpty.\n",
    "\n",
    "I mean, what is an un-birthday present?\n",
    "\n",
    "A present given when it isnt your birthday, of course.\n",
    "\n",
    "Alice considered a little. I like birthday presents best, she said at last.\n",
    "\n",
    "You dont know what youre talking about! cried Humpty Dumpty. How many days are there in a year?\n",
    "\n",
    "Three hundred and sixty-five, said Alice.\n",
    "\n",
    "And how many birthdays have you?\n",
    "\n",
    "One.\n",
    "\n",
    "And if you take one from three hundred and sixty-five, what remains?\n",
    "\n",
    "Three hundred and sixty-four, of course.\n",
    "\n",
    "Humpty Dumpty looked doubtful. Id rather see that done on paper, he said.\n",
    "\n",
    "Alice couldnt help smiling as she took out her memorandum-book, and worked the sum for him:\n",
    "\n",
    "               365\n",
    "                1\n",
    "               ____\n",
    "\n",
    "               364\n",
    "               ___\n",
    "\n",
    "Humpty Dumpty took the book, and looked at it carefully. That seems to be done right he began.\n",
    "\n",
    "Youre holding it upside down! Alice interrupted.\n",
    "\n",
    "To be sure I was! Humpty Dumpty said gaily, as she turned it round for him. I thought it looked a little queer. As I was saying, that seems to be done rightthough I havent time to look it over thoroughly just nowand that shows that there are three hundred and sixty-four days when you might get un-birthday presents\n",
    "\n",
    "Certainly, said Alice.\n",
    "\n",
    "And only one for birthday presents, you know. Theres glory for you!\n",
    "\n",
    "I dont know what you mean by glory, Alice said.\n",
    "\n",
    "Humpty Dumpty smiled contemptuously. Of course you donttill I tell you. I meant theres a nice knock-down argument for you!\n",
    "\n",
    "But glory doesnt mean a nice knock-down argument, Alice objected.\n",
    "\n",
    "When I use a word, Humpty Dumpty said in rather a scornful tone, it means just what I choose it to meanneither more nor less.\n",
    "\n",
    "The question is, said Alice, whether you can make words mean so many different things.\n",
    "\n",
    "The question is, said Humpty Dumpty, which is to be masterthats all.\n",
    "\n",
    "Alice was too much puzzled to say anything, so after a minute Humpty Dumpty began again. Theyve a temper, some of themparticularly verbs, theyre the proudestadjectives you can do anything with, but not verbshowever, I can manage the whole lot of them! Impenetrability! Thats what I say!\n",
    "\n",
    "Would you tell me, please, said Alice what that means?\n",
    "\n",
    "Now you talk like a reasonable child, said Humpty Dumpty, looking very much pleased. I meant by impenetrability that weve had enough of that subject, and it would be just as well if youd mention what you mean to do next, as I suppose you dont mean to stop here all the rest of your life.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thats a great deal to make one word mean, Alice said in a thoughtful tone.\n",
    "\n",
    "When I make a word do a lot of work like that, said Humpty Dumpty, I always pay it extra.\n",
    "\n",
    "Oh! said Alice. She was too much puzzled to make any other remark.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ah, you should see em come round me of a Saturday night, Humpty Dumpty went on, wagging his head gravely from side to side: for to get their wages, you know.\n",
    "\n",
    "(Alice didnt venture to ask what he paid them with; and so you see I cant tell you.)\n",
    "\n",
    "You seem very clever at explaining words, Sir, said Alice. Would you kindly tell me the meaning of the poem called Jabberwocky?\n",
    "\n",
    "Lets hear it, said Humpty Dumpty. I can explain all the poems that were ever inventedand a good many that havent been invented just yet.\n",
    "\n",
    "This sounded very hopeful, so Alice repeated the first verse:\n",
    "\n",
    "     Twas brillig, and the slithy toves\n",
    "      Did gyre and gimble in the wabe;\n",
    "     All mimsy were the borogoves,\n",
    "      And the mome raths outgrabe.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thats enough to begin with, Humpty Dumpty interrupted: there are plenty of hard words there. Brillig means four oclock in the afternoonthe time when you begin broiling things for dinner.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thatll do very well, said Alice: and slithy?\n",
    "\n",
    "Well, slithy means lithe and slimy. Lithe is the same as active. You see its like a portmanteauthere are two meanings packed up into one word.\n",
    "\n",
    "I see it now, Alice remarked thoughtfully: and what are toves?\n",
    "\n",
    "Well, toves are something like badgerstheyre something like lizardsand theyre something like corkscrews.\n",
    "\n",
    "They must be very curious looking creatures.\n",
    "\n",
    "They are that, said Humpty Dumpty: also they make their nests under sun-dialsalso they live on cheese.\n",
    "\n",
    "And whats the gyre and to gimble?\n",
    "\n",
    "To gyre is to go round and round like a gyroscope. To gimble is to make holes like a gimlet.\n",
    "\n",
    "And the wabe is the grass-plot round a sun-dial, I suppose? said Alice, surprised at her own ingenuity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course it is. Its called wabe, you know, because it goes a long way before it, and a long way behind it\n",
    "\n",
    "And a long way beyond it on each side, Alice added.\n",
    "\n",
    "Exactly so. Well, then, mimsy is flimsy and miserable (theres another portmanteau for you). And a borogove is a thin shabby-looking bird with its feathers sticking out all roundsomething like a live mop.\n",
    "\n",
    "And then mome raths? said Alice. Im afraid Im giving you a great deal of trouble.\n",
    "\n",
    "Well, a rath is a sort of green pig: but mome Im not certain about. I think its short for from homemeaning that theyd lost their way, you know.\n",
    "\n",
    "And what does outgrabe mean?\n",
    "\n",
    "Well, outgrabing is something between bellowing and whistling, with a kind of sneeze in the middle: however, youll hear it done, maybedown in the wood yonderand when youve once heard it youll be quite content. Whos been repeating all that hard stuff to you?\n",
    "\n",
    "I read it in a book, said Alice. But I had some poetry repeated to me, much easier than that, byTweedledee, I think it was.\n",
    "\n",
    "As to poetry, you know, said Humpty Dumpty, stretching out one of his great hands, I can repeat poetry as well as other folk, if it comes to that\n",
    "\n",
    "Oh, it neednt come to that! Alice hastily said, hoping to keep him from beginning.\n",
    "\n",
    "The piece Im going to repeat, he went on without noticing her remark, was written entirely for your amusement.\n",
    "\n",
    "Alice felt that in that case she really ought to listen to it, so she sat down, and said Thank you rather sadly.\n",
    "\n",
    "     In winter, when the fields are white,\n",
    "     I sing this song for your delight\n",
    "\n",
    "only I dont sing it, he added, as an explanation.\n",
    "\n",
    "I see you dont, said Alice.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you can see whether Im singing or not, youve sharper eyes than most. Humpty Dumpty remarked severely. Alice was silent.\n",
    "\n",
    "     In spring, when woods are getting green,\n",
    "     Ill try and tell you what I mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thank you very much, said Alice.\n",
    "\n",
    "     In summer, when the days are long,\n",
    "     Perhaps youll understand the song:\n",
    "     In autumn, when the leaves are brown,\n",
    "     Take pen and ink, and write it down.\n",
    "\n",
    "I will, if I can remember it so long, said Alice.\n",
    "\n",
    "You neednt go on making remarks like that, Humpty Dumpty said: theyre not sensible, and they put me out.\n",
    "\n",
    "     I sent a message to the fish:\n",
    "     I told them This is what I wish.\n",
    "\n",
    "     The little fishes of the sea,\n",
    "     They sent an answer back to me.\n",
    "\n",
    "     The little fishes answer was\n",
    "     We cannot do it, Sir, because\n",
    "\n",
    "Im afraid I dont quite understand, said Alice.\n",
    "\n",
    "It gets easier further on, Humpty Dumpty replied.\n",
    "\n",
    "     I sent to them again to say\n",
    "     It will be better to obey.\n",
    "\n",
    "     The fishes answered with a grin,\n",
    "     Why, what a temper you are in!\n",
    "\n",
    "     I told them once, I told them twice:\n",
    "     They would not listen to advice.\n",
    "\n",
    "     I took a kettle large and new,\n",
    "     Fit for the deed I had to do.\n",
    "\n",
    "     My heart went hop, my heart went thump;\n",
    "     I filled the kettle at the pump.\n",
    "\n",
    "     Then some one came to me and said,\n",
    "     The little fishes are in bed.\n",
    "\n",
    "     I said to him, I said it plain,\n",
    "     Then you must wake them up again.\n",
    "\n",
    "     I said it very loud and clear;\n",
    "     I went and shouted in his ear.\n",
    "\n",
    "Humpty Dumpty raised his voice almost to a scream as he repeated this verse, and Alice thought with a shudder, I wouldnt have been the messenger for anything!\n",
    "\n",
    "     But he was very stiff and proud;\n",
    "     He said You neednt shout so loud!\n",
    "\n",
    "     And he was very proud and stiff;\n",
    "     He said Id go and wake them, if\n",
    "\n",
    "     I took a corkscrew from the shelf:\n",
    "     I went to wake them up myself.\n",
    "\n",
    "     And when I found the door was locked,\n",
    "     I pulled and pushed and kicked and knocked.\n",
    "\n",
    "     And when I found the door was shut,\n",
    "     I tried to turn the handle, but\n",
    "\n",
    "There was a long pause.\n",
    "\n",
    "Is that all? Alice timidly asked.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thats all, said Humpty Dumpty. Good-bye.\n",
    "\n",
    "This was rather sudden, Alice thought: but, after such a very strong hint that she ought to be going, she felt that it would hardly be civil to stay. So she got up, and held out her hand. Good-bye, till we meet again! she said as cheerfully as she could.\n",
    "\n",
    "I shouldnt know you again if we did meet, Humpty Dumpty replied in a discontented tone, giving her one of his fingers to shake; youre so exactly like other people.\n",
    "\n",
    "The face is what one goes by, generally, Alice remarked in a thoughtful tone.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thats just what I complain of, said Humpty Dumpty. Your face is the same as everybody hasthe two eyes, so (marking their places in the air with this thumb) nose in the middle, mouth under. Its always the same. Now if you had the two eyes on the same side of the nose, for instanceor the mouth at the topthat would be some help.\n",
    "\n",
    "It wouldnt look nice, Alice objected. But Humpty Dumpty only shut his eyes and said Wait till youve tried.\n",
    "\n",
    "Alice waited a minute to see if he would speak again, but as he never opened his eyes or took any further notice of her, she said Good-bye! once more, and, getting no answer to this, she quietly walked away: but she couldnt help saying to herself as she went, Of all the unsatisfactory (she repeated this aloud, as it was a great comfort to have such a long word to say) of all the unsatisfactory people I ever met She never finished the sentence, for at this moment a heavy crash shook the forest from end to end.\n",

    "CHAPTER VII. The Lion and the Unicorn\n",
    "\n",
    "The next moment soldiers came running through the wood, at first in twos and threes, then ten or twenty together, and at last in such crowds that they seemed to fill the whole forest. Alice got behind a tree, for fear of being run over, and watched them go by.\n",
    "\n",
    "She thought that in all her life she had never seen soldiers so uncertain on their feet: they were always tripping over something or other, and whenever one went down, several more always fell over him, so that the ground was soon covered with little heaps of men.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then came the horses. Having four feet, these managed rather better than the foot-soldiers: but even they stumbled now and then; and it seemed to be a regular rule that, whenever a horse stumbled the rider fell off instantly. The confusion got worse every moment, and Alice was very glad to get out of the wood into an open place, where she found the White King seated on the ground, busily writing in his memorandum-book.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ive sent them all! the King cried in a tone of delight, on seeing Alice. Did you happen to meet any soldiers, my dear, as you came through the wood?\n",
    "\n",
    "Yes, I did, said Alice: several thousand, I should think.\n",
    "\n",
    "Four thousand two hundred and seven, thats the exact number, the King said, referring to his book. I couldnt send all the horses, you know, because two of them are wanted in the game. And I havent sent the two Messengers, either. Theyre both gone to the town. Just look along the road, and tell me if you can see either of them.\n",
    "\n",
    "I see nobody on the road, said Alice.\n",
    "\n",
    "I only wish I had such eyes, the King remarked in a fretful tone. To be able to see Nobody! And at that distance, too! Why, its as much as I can do to see real people, by this light!\n",
    "\n",
    "All this was lost on Alice, who was still looking intently along the road, shading her eyes with one hand. I see somebody now! she exclaimed at last. But hes coming very slowlyand what curious attitudes he goes into! (For the messenger kept skipping up and down, and wriggling like an eel, as he came along, with his great hands spread out like fans on each side.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Not at all, said the King. Hes an Anglo-Saxon Messengerand those are Anglo-Saxon attitudes. He only does them when hes happy. His name is Haigha. (He pronounced it so as to rhyme with mayor.)\n",
    "\n",
    "I love my love with an H, Alice couldnt help beginning, because he is Happy. I hate him with an H, because he is Hideous. I fed him withwithwith Ham-sandwiches and Hay. His name is Haigha, and he lives\n",
    "\n",
    "He lives on the Hill, the King remarked simply, without the least idea that he was joining in the game, while Alice was still hesitating for the name of a town beginning with H. The other Messengers called Hatta. I must have two, you knowto come and go. One to come, and one to go.\n",
    "\n",
    "I beg your pardon? said Alice.\n",
    "\n",
    "It isnt respectable to beg, said the King.\n",
    "\n",
    "I only meant that I didnt understand, said Alice. Why one to come and one to go?\n",
    "\n",
    "Didnt I tell you? the King repeated impatiently. I must have twoto fetch and carry. One to fetch, and one to carry.\n",
    "\n",
    "At this moment the Messenger arrived: he was far too much out of breath to say a word, and could only wave his hands about, and make the most fearful faces at the poor King.\n",
    "\n",
    "This young lady loves you with an H, the King said, introducing Alice in the hope of turning off the Messengers attention from himselfbut it was no usethe Anglo-Saxon attitudes only got more extraordinary every moment, while the great eyes rolled wildly from side to side.\n",
    "\n",
    "You alarm me! said the King. I feel faintGive me a ham sandwich!\n",
    "\n",
    "On which the Messenger, to Alices great amusement, opened a bag that hung round his neck, and handed a sandwich to the King, who devoured it greedily.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another sandwich! said the King.\n",
    "\n",
    "Theres nothing but hay left now, the Messenger said, peeping into the bag.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hay, then, the King murmured in a faint whisper.\n",
    "\n",
    "Alice was glad to see that it revived him a good deal. Theres nothing like eating hay when youre faint, he remarked to her, as he munched away.\n",
    "\n",
    "I should think throwing cold water over you would be better, Alice suggested: or some sal-volatile.\n",
    "\n",
    "I didnt say there was nothing better, the King replied. I said there was nothing like it. Which Alice did not venture to deny.\n",
    "\n",
    "Who did you pass on the road? the King went on, holding out his hand to the Messenger for some more hay.\n",
    "\n",
    "Nobody, said the Messenger.\n",
    "\n",
    "Quite right, said the King: this young lady saw him too. So of course Nobody walks slower than you.\n",
    "\n",
    "I do my best, the Messenger said in a sulky tone. Im sure nobody walks much faster than I do!\n",
    "\n",
    "He cant do that, said the King, or else hed have been here first. However, now youve got your breath, you may tell us whats happened in the town.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ill whisper it, said the Messenger, putting his hands to his mouth in the shape of a trumpet, and stooping so as to get close to the Kings ear. Alice was sorry for this, as she wanted to hear the news too. However, instead of whispering, he simply shouted at the top of his voice Theyre at it again!\n",
    "\n",
    "Do you call that a whisper? cried the poor King, jumping up and shaking himself. If you do such a thing again, Ill have you buttered! It went through and through my head like an earthquake!\n",
    "\n",
    "It would have to be a very tiny earthquake! thought Alice. Who are at it again? she ventured to ask.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why the Lion and the Unicorn, of course, said the King.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fighting for the crown?\n",
    "\n",
    "Yes, to be sure, said the King: and the best of the joke is, that its my crown all the while! Lets run and see them. And they trotted off, Alice repeating to herself, as she ran, the words of the old song:\n",
    "\n",
    "   The Lion and the Unicorn were fighting for the crown:\n",
    "   The Lion beat the Unicorn all round the town.\n",
    "   Some gave them white bread, some gave them brown;\n",
    "   Some gave them plum-cake and drummed them out of town.\n",
    "\n",
    "Doesthe onethat winsget the crown? she asked, as well as she could, for the run was putting her quite out of breath.\n",
    "\n",
    "Dear me, no! said the King. What an idea!\n",
    "\n",
    "Would yoube good enough, Alice panted out, after running a little further, to stop a minutejust to getones breath again?\n",
    "\n",
    "Im good enough, the King said, only Im not strong enough. You see, a minute goes by so fearfully quick. You might as well try to stop a Bandersnatch!\n",
    "\n",
    "Alice had no more breath for talking, so they trotted on in silence, till they came in sight of a great crowd, in the middle of which the Lion and Unicorn were fighting. They were in such a cloud of dust, that at first Alice could not make out which was which: but she soon managed to distinguish the Unicorn by his horn.\n",
    "\n",
    "They placed themselves close to where Hatta, the other messenger, was standing watching the fight, with a cup of tea in one hand and a piece of bread-and-butter in the other.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hes only just out of prison, and he hadnt finished his tea when he was sent in, Haigha whispered to Alice: and they only give them oyster-shells in thereso you see hes very hungry and thirsty. How are you, dear child? he went on, putting his arm affectionately round Hattas neck.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hatta looked round and nodded, and went on with his bread and butter.\n",
    "\n",
    "Were you happy in prison, dear child? said Haigha.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hatta looked round once more, and this time a tear or two trickled down his cheek: but not a word would he say.\n",
    "\n",
    "Speak, cant you! Haigha cried impatiently. But Hatta only munched away, and drank some more tea.\n",
    "\n",
    "Speak, wont you! cried the King. How are they getting on with the fight?\n",
    "\n",
    "Hatta made a desperate effort, and swallowed a large piece of bread-and-butter. Theyre getting on very well, he said in a choking voice: each of them has been down about eighty-seven times.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then I suppose theyll soon bring the white bread and the brown? Alice ventured to remark.\n",
    "\n",
    "Its waiting for em now, said Hatta: this is a bit of it as Im eating.\n",
    "\n",
    "There was a pause in the fight just then, and the Lion and the Unicorn sat down, panting, while the King called out Ten minutes allowed for refreshments! Haigha and Hatta set to work at once, carrying rough trays of white and brown bread. Alice took a piece to taste, but it was very dry.\n",
    "\n",
    "I dont think theyll fight any more to-day, the King said to Hatta: go and order the drums to begin. And Hatta went bounding away like a grasshopper.\n",
    "\n",
    "For a minute or two Alice stood silent, watching him. Suddenly she brightened up. Look, look! she cried, pointing eagerly. Theres the White Queen running across the country! She came flying out of the wood over yonderHow fast those Queens can run!\n",
    "\n",
    "Theres some enemy after her, no doubt, the King said, without even looking round. That woods full of them.\n",
    "\n",
    "But arent you going to run and help her? Alice asked, very much surprised at his taking it so quietly.\n",
    "\n",
    "No use, no use! said the King. She runs so fearfully quick. You might as well try to catch a Bandersnatch! But Ill make a memorandum about her, if you likeShes a dear good creature, he repeated softly to himself, as he opened his memorandum-book. Do you spell creature with a double e?\n",
    "\n",
    "At this moment the Unicorn sauntered by them, with his hands in his pockets. I had the best of it this time? he said to the King, just glancing at him as he passed.\n",
    "\n",
    "A littlea little, the King replied, rather nervously. You shouldnt have run him through with your horn, you know.\n",
    "\n",
    "It didnt hurt him, the Unicorn said carelessly, and he was going on, when his eye happened to fall upon Alice: he turned round rather instantly, and stood for some time looking at her with an air of the deepest disgust.\n",
    "\n",
    "Whatisthis? he said at last.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a child! Haigha replied eagerly, coming in front of Alice to introduce her, and spreading out both his hands towards her in an Anglo-Saxon attitude. We only found it to-day. Its as large as life, and twice as natural!\n",
    "\n",
    "I always thought they were fabulous monsters! said the Unicorn. Is it alive?\n",
    "\n",
    "It can talk, said Haigha, solemnly.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Unicorn looked dreamily at Alice, and said Talk, child.\n",
    "\n",
    "Alice could not help her lips curling up into a smile as she began: Do you know, I always thought Unicorns were fabulous monsters, too! I never saw one alive before!\n",
    "\n",
    "Well, now that we have seen each other, said the Unicorn, if youll believe in me, Ill believe in you. Is that a bargain?\n",
    "\n",
    "Yes, if you like, said Alice.\n",
    "\n",
    "Come, fetch out the plum-cake, old man! the Unicorn went on, turning from her to the King. None of your brown bread for me!\n",
    "\n",
    "Certainlycertainly! the King muttered, and beckoned to Haigha. Open the bag! he whispered. Quick! Not that onethats full of hay!\n",
    "\n",
    "Haigha took a large cake out of the bag, and gave it to Alice to hold, while he got out a dish and carving-knife. How they all came out of it Alice couldnt guess. It was just like a conjuring-trick, she thought.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Lion had joined them while this was going on: he looked very tired and sleepy, and his eyes were half shut. Whats this! he said, blinking lazily at Alice, and speaking in a deep hollow tone that sounded like the tolling of a great bell.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ah, what is it, now? the Unicorn cried eagerly. Youll never guess! I couldnt.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Lion looked at Alice wearily. Are you animalvegetableor mineral? he said, yawning at every other word.\n",
    "\n",
    "Its a fabulous monster! the Unicorn cried out, before Alice could reply.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then hand round the plum-cake, Monster, the Lion said, lying down and putting his chin on his paws. And sit down, both of you, (to the King and the Unicorn): fair play with the cake, you know!\n",
    "\n",
    "The King was evidently very uncomfortable at having to sit down between the two great creatures; but there was no other place for him.\n",
    "\n",
    "What a fight we might have for the crown, now! the Unicorn said, looking slyly up at the crown, which the poor King was nearly shaking off his head, he trembled so much.\n",
    "\n",
    "I should win easy, said the Lion.\n",
    "\n",
    "Im not so sure of that, said the Unicorn.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why, I beat you all round the town, you chicken! the Lion replied angrily, half getting up as he spoke.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here the King interrupted, to prevent the quarrel going on: he was very nervous, and his voice quite quivered. All round the town? he said. Thats a good long way. Did you go by the old bridge, or the market-place? You get the best view by the old bridge.\n",
    "\n",
    "Im sure I dont know, the Lion growled out as he lay down again. There was too much dust to see anything. What a time the Monster is, cutting up that cake!\n",
    "\n",
    "Alice had seated herself on the bank of a little brook, with the great dish on her knees, and was sawing away diligently with the knife. Its very provoking! she said, in reply to the Lion (she was getting quite used to being called the Monster). Ive cut several slices already, but they always join on again!\n",
    "\n",
    "You dont know how to manage Looking-glass cakes, the Unicorn remarked. Hand it round first, and cut it afterwards.\n",
    "\n",
    "This sounded nonsense, but Alice very obediently got up, and carried the dish round, and the cake divided itself into three pieces as she did so. Now cut it up, said the Lion, as she returned to her place with the empty dish.\n",
    "\n",
    "I say, this isnt fair! cried the Unicorn, as Alice sat with the knife in her hand, very much puzzled how to begin. The Monster has given the Lion twice as much as me!\n",
    "\n",
    "Shes kept none for herself, anyhow, said the Lion. Do you like plum-cake, Monster?\n",
    "\n",
    "But before Alice could answer him, the drums began.\n",
    "\n",
    "Where the noise came from, she couldnt make out: the air seemed full of it, and it rang through and through her head till she felt quite deafened. She started to her feet and sprang across the little brook in her terror,\n",
    "\n",
    "  *    *    *    *    *    *    *\n",
    "\n",
    "    *    *    *    *    *    *\n",
    "\n",
    "  *    *    *    *    *    *    *\n",
    "\n",
    "and had just time to see the Lion and the Unicorn rise to their feet, with angry looks at being interrupted in their feast, before she dropped to her knees, and put her hands over her ears, vainly trying to shut out the dreadful uproar.\n",
    "\n",
    "If that doesnt drum them out of town, she thought to herself, nothing ever will!\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "CHAPTER VIII. Its my own Invention\n",
    "\n",
    "After a while the noise seemed gradually to die away, till all was dead silence, and Alice lifted up her head in some alarm. There was no one to be seen, and her first thought was that she must have been dreaming about the Lion and the Unicorn and those queer Anglo-Saxon Messengers. However, there was the great dish still lying at her feet, on which she had tried to cut the plum-cake, So I wasnt dreaming, after all, she said to herself, unlessunless were all part of the same dream. Only I do hope its my dream, and not the Red Kings! I dont like belonging to another persons dream, she went on in a rather complaining tone: Ive a great mind to go and wake him, and see what happens!\n",
    "\n",
    "At this moment her thoughts were interrupted by a loud shouting of Ahoy! Ahoy! Check! and a Knight dressed in crimson armour came galloping down upon her, brandishing a great club. Just as he reached her, the horse stopped suddenly: Youre my prisoner! the Knight cried, as he tumbled off his horse.\n",
    "\n",
    "Startled as she was, Alice was more frightened for him than for herself at the moment, and watched him with some anxiety as he mounted again. As soon as he was comfortably in the saddle, he began once more Youre my but here another voice broke in Ahoy! Ahoy! Check! and Alice looked round in some surprise for the new enemy.\n",
    "\n",
    "This time it was a White Knight. He drew up at Alices side, and tumbled off his horse just as the Red Knight had done: then he got on again, and the two Knights sat and looked at each other for some time without speaking. Alice looked from one to the other in some bewilderment.\n",
    "\n",
    "Shes my prisoner, you know! the Red Knight said at last.\n",
    "\n",
    "Yes, but then I came and rescued her! the White Knight replied.\n",
    "\n",
    "Well, we must fight for her, then, said the Red Knight, as he took up his helmet (which hung from the saddle, and was something the shape of a horses head), and put it on.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will observe the Rules of Battle, of course? the White Knight remarked, putting on his helmet too.\n",
    "\n",
    "I always do, said the Red Knight, and they began banging away at each other with such fury that Alice got behind a tree to be out of the way of the blows.\n",
    "\n",
    "I wonder, now, what the Rules of Battle are, she said to herself, as she watched the fight, timidly peeping out from her hiding-place: one Rule seems to be, that if one Knight hits the other, he knocks him off his horse, and if he misses, he tumbles off himselfand another Rule seems to be that they hold their clubs with their arms, as if they were Punch and JudyWhat a noise they make when they tumble! Just like a whole set of fire-irons falling into the fender! And how quiet the horses are! They let them get on and off them just as if they were tables!\n",
    "\n",
    "Another Rule of Battle, that Alice had not noticed, seemed to be that they always fell on their heads, and the battle ended with their both falling off in this way, side by side: when they got up again, they shook hands, and then the Red Knight mounted and galloped off.\n",
    "\n",
    "It was a glorious victory, wasnt it? said the White Knight, as he came up panting.\n",
    "\n",
    "I dont know, Alice said doubtfully. I dont want to be anybodys prisoner. I want to be a Queen.\n",
    "\n",
    "So you will, when youve crossed the next brook, said the White Knight. Ill see you safe to the end of the woodand then I must go back, you know. Thats the end of my move.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thank you very much, said Alice. May I help you off with your helmet? It was evidently more than he could manage by himself; however, she managed to shake him out of it at last.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now one can breathe more easily, said the Knight, putting back his shaggy hair with both hands, and turning his gentle face and large mild eyes to Alice. She thought she had never seen such a strange-looking soldier in all her life.\n",
    "\n",
    "He was dressed in tin armour, which seemed to fit him very badly, and he had a queer-shaped little deal box fastened across his shoulder, upside-down, and with the lid hanging open. Alice looked at it with great curiosity.\n",
    "\n",
    "I see youre admiring my little box. the Knight said in a friendly tone. Its my own inventionto keep clothes and sandwiches in. You see I carry it upside-down, so that the rain cant get in.\n",
    "\n",
    "But the things can get out, Alice gently remarked. Do you know the lids open?\n",
    "\n",
    "I didnt know it, the Knight said, a shade of vexation passing over his face. Then all the things must have fallen out! And the box is no use without them. He unfastened it as he spoke, and was just going to throw it into the bushes, when a sudden thought seemed to strike him, and he hung it carefully on a tree. Can you guess why I did that? he said to Alice.\n",
    "\n",
    "Alice shook her head.\n",
    "\n",
    "In hopes some bees may make a nest in itthen I should get the honey.\n",
    "\n",
    "But youve got a bee-hiveor something like onefastened to the saddle, said Alice.\n",
    "\n",
    "Yes, its a very good bee-hive, the Knight said in a discontented tone, one of the best kind. But not a single bee has come near it yet. And the other thing is a mouse-trap. I suppose the mice keep the bees outor the bees keep the mice out, I dont know which.\n",
    "\n",
    "I was wondering what the mouse-trap was for, said Alice. It isnt very likely there would be any mice on the horses back.\n",
    "\n",
    "Not very likely, perhaps, said the Knight: but if they do come, I dont choose to have them running all about.\n",
    "\n",
    "You see, he went on after a pause, its as well to be provided for everything. Thats the reason the horse has all those anklets round his feet.\n",
    "\n",
    "But what are they for? Alice asked in a tone of great curiosity.\n",
    "\n",
    "To guard against the bites of sharks, the Knight replied. Its an invention of my own. And now help me on. Ill go with you to the end of the woodWhats the dish for?\n",
    "\n",
    "Its meant for plum-cake, said Alice.\n",
    "\n",
    "Wed better take it with us, the Knight said. Itll come in handy if we find any plum-cake. Help me to get it into this bag.\n",
    "\n",
    "This took a very long time to manage, though Alice held the bag open very carefully, because the Knight was so very awkward in putting in the dish: the first two or three times that he tried he fell in himself instead. Its rather a tight fit, you see, he said, as they got it in a last; There are so many candlesticks in the bag. And he hung it to the saddle, which was already loaded with bunches of carrots, and fire-irons, and many other things.\n",
    "\n",
    "I hope youve got your hair well fastened on? he continued, as they set off.\n",
    "\n",
    "Only in the usual way, Alice said, smiling.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thats hardly enough, he said, anxiously. You see the wind is so very strong here. Its as strong as soup.\n",
    "\n",
    "Have you invented a plan for keeping the hair from being blown off? Alice enquired.\n",
    "\n",
    "Not yet, said the Knight. But Ive got a plan for keeping it from falling off.\n",
    "\n",
    "I should like to hear it, very much.\n",
    "\n",
    "First you take an upright stick, said the Knight. Then you make your hair creep up it, like a fruit-tree. Now the reason hair falls off is because it hangs downthings never fall upwards, you know. Its a plan of my own invention. You may try it if you like.\n",
    "\n",
    "It didnt sound a comfortable plan, Alice thought, and for a few minutes she walked on in silence, puzzling over the idea, and every now and then stopping to help the poor Knight, who certainly was not a good rider.\n",
    "\n",
    "Whenever the horse stopped (which it did very often), he fell off in front; and whenever it went on again (which it generally did rather suddenly), he fell off behind. Otherwise he kept on pretty well, except that he had a habit of now and then falling off sideways; and as he generally did this on the side on which Alice was walking, she soon found that it was the best plan not to walk quite close to the horse.\n",
    "\n",
    "Im afraid youve not had much practice in riding, she ventured to say, as she was helping him up from his fifth tumble.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Knight looked very much surprised, and a little offended at the remark. What makes you say that? he asked, as he scrambled back into the saddle, keeping hold of Alices hair with one hand, to save himself from falling over on the other side.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because people dont fall off quite so often, when theyve had much practice.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ive had plenty of practice, the Knight said very gravely: plenty of practice!\n",
    "\n",
    "Alice could think of nothing better to say than Indeed? but she said it as heartily as she could. They went on a little way in silence after this, the Knight with his eyes shut, muttering to himself, and Alice watching anxiously for the next tumble.\n",
    "\n",
    "The great art of riding, the Knight suddenly began in a loud voice, waving his right arm as he spoke, is to keep Here the sentence ended as suddenly as it had begun, as the Knight fell heavily on the top of his head exactly in the path where Alice was walking. She was quite frightened this time, and said in an anxious tone, as she picked him up, I hope no bones are broken?\n",
    "\n",
    "None to speak of, the Knight said, as if he didnt mind breaking two or three of them. The great art of riding, as I was saying, isto keep your balance properly. Like this, you know\n",
    "\n",
    "He let go the bridle, and stretched out both his arms to show Alice what he meant, and this time he fell flat on his back, right under the horses feet.\n",
    "\n",
    "Plenty of practice! he went on repeating, all the time that Alice was getting him on his feet again. Plenty of practice!\n",
    "\n",
    "Its too ridiculous! cried Alice, losing all her patience this time. You ought to have a wooden horse on wheels, that you ought!\n",
    "\n",
    "Does that kind go smoothly? the Knight asked in a tone of great interest, clasping his arms round the horses neck as he spoke, just in time to save himself from tumbling off again.\n",
    "\n",
    "Much more smoothly than a live horse, Alice said, with a little scream of laughter, in spite of all she could do to prevent it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ill get one, the Knight said thoughtfully to himself. One or twoseveral.\n",
    "\n",
    "There was a short silence after this, and then the Knight went on again. Im a great hand at inventing things. Now, I daresay you noticed, that last time you picked me up, that I was looking rather thoughtful?\n",
    "\n",
    "You were a little grave, said Alice.\n",
    "\n",
    "Well, just then I was inventing a new way of getting over a gatewould you like to hear it?\n",
    "\n",
    "Very much indeed, Alice said politely.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ill tell you how I came to think of it, said the Knight. You see, I said to myself, The only difficulty is with the feet: the head is high enough already. Now, first I put my head on the top of the gatethen I stand on my headthen the feet are high enough, you seethen Im over, you see.\n",
    "\n",
    "Yes, I suppose youd be over when that was done, Alice said thoughtfully: but dont you think it would be rather hard?\n",
    "\n",
    "I havent tried it yet, the Knight said, gravely: so I cant tell for certainbut Im afraid it would be a little hard.\n",
    "\n",
    "He looked so vexed at the idea, that Alice changed the subject hastily. What a curious helmet youve got! she said cheerfully. Is that your invention too?\n",
    "\n",
    "The Knight looked down proudly at his helmet, which hung from the saddle. Yes, he said, but Ive invented a better one than thatlike a sugar loaf. When I used to wear it, if I fell off the horse, it always touched the ground directly. So I had a very little way to fall, you seeBut there was the danger of falling into it, to be sure. That happened to me onceand the worst of it was, before I could get out again, the other White Knight came and put it on. He thought it was his own helmet.\n",
    "\n",
    "The knight looked so solemn about it that Alice did not dare to laugh. Im afraid you must have hurt him, she said in a trembling voice, being on the top of his head.\n",
    "\n",
    "I had to kick him, of course, the Knight said, very seriously. And then he took the helmet off againbut it took hours and hours to get me out. I was as fast asas lightning, you know.\n",
    "\n",
    "But thats a different kind of fastness, Alice objected.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Knight shook his head. It was all kinds of fastness with me, I can assure you! he said. He raised his hands in some excitement as he said this, and instantly rolled out of the saddle, and fell headlong into a deep ditch.\n",
    "\n",
    "Alice ran to the side of the ditch to look for him. She was rather startled by the fall, as for some time he had kept on very well, and she was afraid that he really was hurt this time. However, though she could see nothing but the soles of his feet, she was much relieved to hear that he was talking on in his usual tone. All kinds of fastness, he repeated: but it was careless of him to put another mans helmet onwith the man in it, too.\n",
    "\n",
    "How can you go on talking so quietly, head downwards? Alice asked, as she dragged him out by the feet, and laid him in a heap on the bank.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Knight looked surprised at the question. What does it matter where my body happens to be? he said. My mind goes on working all the same. In fact, the more head downwards I am, the more I keep inventing new things.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now the cleverest thing of the sort that I ever did, he went on after a pause, was inventing a new pudding during the meat-course.\n",
    "\n",
    "In time to have it cooked for the next course? said Alice. Well, not the next course, the Knight said in a slow thoughtful tone: no, certainly not the next course.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then it would have to be the next day. I suppose you wouldnt have two pudding-courses in one dinner?\n",
    "\n",
    "Well, not the next day, the Knight repeated as before: not the next day. In fact, he went on, holding his head down, and his voice getting lower and lower, I dont believe that pudding ever was cooked! In fact, I dont believe that pudding ever will be cooked! And yet it was a very clever pudding to invent.\n",
    "\n",
    "What did you mean it to be made of? Alice asked, hoping to cheer him up, for the poor Knight seemed quite low-spirited about it.\n",
    "\n",
    "It began with blotting paper, the Knight answered with a groan.\n",
    "\n",
    "That wouldnt be very nice, Im afraid\n",
    "\n",
    "Not very nice alone, he interrupted, quite eagerly: but youve no idea what a difference it makes mixing it with other thingssuch as gunpowder and sealing-wax. And here I must leave you. They had just come to the end of the wood.\n",
    "\n",
    "Alice could only look puzzled: she was thinking of the pudding.\n",
    "\n",
    "You are sad, the Knight said in an anxious tone: let me sing you a song to comfort you.\n",
    "\n",
    "Is it very long? Alice asked, for she had heard a good deal of poetry that day.\n",
    "\n",
    "Its long, said the Knight, but very, very beautiful. Everybody that hears me sing iteither it brings the tears into their eyes, or else\n",
    "\n",
    "Or else what? said Alice, for the Knight had made a sudden pause.\n",
    "\n",
    "Or else it doesnt, you know. The name of the song is called Haddocks Eyes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Oh, thats the name of the song, is it? Alice said, trying to feel interested.\n",
    "\n",
    "No, you dont understand, the Knight said, looking a little vexed. Thats what the name is called. The name really is The Aged Aged Man.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then I ought to have said Thats what the song is called? Alice corrected herself.\n",
    "\n",
    "No, you oughtnt: thats quite another thing! The song is called Ways and Means: but thats only what its called, you know!\n",
    "\n",
    "Well, what is the song, then? said Alice, who was by this time completely bewildered.\n",
    "\n",
    "I was coming to that, the Knight said. The song really is A-sitting On A Gate: and the tunes my own invention.\n",
    "\n",
    "So saying, he stopped his horse and let the reins fall on its neck: then, slowly beating time with one hand, and with a faint smile lighting up his gentle foolish face, as if he enjoyed the music of his song, he began.\n",
    "\n",
    "Of all the strange things that Alice saw in her journey Through The Looking-Glass, this was the one that she always remembered most clearly. Years afterwards she could bring the whole scene back again, as if it had been only yesterdaythe mild blue eyes and kindly smile of the Knightthe setting sun gleaming through his hair, and shining on his armour in a blaze of light that quite dazzled herthe horse quietly moving about, with the reins hanging loose on his neck, cropping the grass at her feetand the black shadows of the forest behindall this she took in like a picture, as, with one hand shading her eyes, she leant against a tree, watching the strange pair, and listening, in a half dream, to the melancholy music of the song.\n",
    "\n",
    "But the tune isnt his own invention, she said to herself: its I give thee all, I can no more. She stood and listened very attentively, but no tears came into her eyes.\n",
    "\n",
    "     Ill tell thee everything I can;\n",
    "      Theres little to relate.\n",
    "     I saw an aged aged man,\n",
    "      A-sitting on a gate.\n",
    "     Who are you, aged man? I said,\n",
    "      and how is it you live?\n",
    "      And his answer trickled through my head\n",
    "      Like water through a sieve.\n",
    "\n",
    "     He said I look for butterflies\n",
    "      That sleep among the wheat:\n",
    "     I make them into mutton-pies,\n",
    "      And sell them in the street.\n",
    "     I sell them unto men, he said,\n",
    "      Who sail on stormy seas;\n",
    "     And thats the way I get my bread\n",
    "      A trifle, if you please.\n",
    "\n",
    "     But I was thinking of a plan\n",
    "      To dye ones whiskers green,\n",
    "     And always use so large a fan\n",
    "      That they could not be seen.\n",
    "     So, having no reply to give\n",
    "      To what the old man said,\n",
    "     I cried, Come, tell me how you live!\n",
    "       And thumped him on the head.\n",
    "\n",
    "     His accents mild took up the tale:\n",
    "      He said I go my ways,\n",
    "     And when I find a mountain-rill,\n",

Youve only a few yards to go, he said, down the hill and over that little brook, and then youll be a QueenBut youll stay and see me off first? he added as Alice turned with an eager look in the direction to which he pointed. I shant be long. Youll wait and wave your handkerchief when I get to that turn in the road? I think itll encourage me, you see.\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course Ill wait, said Alice: and thank you very much for coming so farand for the songI liked it very much.\n",

    "I hope so, the Knight said doubtfully: but you didnt cry so much as I thought you would.\n",
    "\n",
    "So they shook hands, and then the Knight rode slowly away into the forest. It wont take long to see him off, I expect, Alice said to herself, as she stood watching him. There he goes! Right on his head as usual! However, he gets on again pretty easilythat comes of having so many things hung round the horse So she went on talking to herself, as she watched the horse walking leisurely along the road, and the Knight tumbling off, first on one side and then on the other. After the fourth or fifth tumble he reached the turn, and then she waved her handkerchief to him, and waited till he was out of sight.\n",

    "\n",
    "Well, this is grand! said Alice. I never expected I should be a Queen so soonand Ill tell you what it is, your majesty, she went on in a severe tone (she was always rather fond of scolding herself), itll never do for you to be lolling about on the grass like that! Queens have to be dignified, you know!\n",
    "\n",
    "So she got up and walked aboutrather stiffly just at first, as she was afraid that the crown might come off: but she comforted herself with the thought that there was nobody to see her, and if I really am a Queen, she said as she sat down again, I shall be able to manage it quite well in time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Everything was happening so oddly that she didnt feel a bit surprised at finding the Red Queen and the White Queen sitting close to her, one on each side: she would have liked very much to ask them how they came there, but she feared it would not be quite civil. However, there would be no harm, she thought, in asking if the game was over. Please, would you tell me she began, looking timidly at the Red Queen.\n",
    "\n",
    "Speak when youre spoken to! The Queen sharply interrupted her.\n",
    "\n",
    "But if everybody obeyed that rule, said Alice, who was always ready for a little argument, and if you only spoke when you were spoken to, and the other person always waited for you to begin, you see nobody would ever say anything, so that\n",
    "\n",
    "Ridiculous! cried the Queen. Why, dont you see, child here she broke off with a frown, and, after thinking for a minute, suddenly changed the subject of the conversation. What do you mean by If you really are a Queen? What right have you to call yourself so? You cant be a Queen, you know, till youve passed the proper examination. And the sooner we begin it, the better.\n",
    "\n",
    "I only said if! poor Alice pleaded in a piteous tone.\n",
    "\n",
    "The two Queens looked at each other, and the Red Queen remarked, with a little shudder, She says she only said if\n",
    "\n",
    "But she said a great deal more than that! the White Queen moaned, wringing her hands. Oh, ever so much more than that!\n",
    "\n",
    "So you did, you know, the Red Queen said to Alice. Always speak the truththink before you speakand write it down afterwards.\n",
    "\n",
    "Im sure I didnt mean Alice was beginning, but the Red Queen interrupted her impatiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thats just what I complain of! You should have meant! What do you suppose is the use of child without any meaning? Even a joke should have some meaningand a childs more important than a joke, I hope. You couldnt deny that, even if you tried with both hands.\n",
    "\n",
    "I dont deny things with my hands, Alice objected.\n",
    "\n",
    "Nobody said you did, said the Red Queen. I said you couldnt if you tried.\n",
    "\n",
    "Shes in that state of mind, said the White Queen, that she wants to deny somethingonly she doesnt know what to deny!\n",
    "\n",
    "A nasty, vicious temper, the Red Queen remarked; and then there was an uncomfortable silence for a minute or two.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Red Queen broke the silence by saying to the White Queen, I invite you to Alices dinner-party this afternoon.\n",
    "\n",
    "The White Queen smiled feebly, and said And I invite you.\n",
    "\n",
    "I didnt know I was to have a party at all, said Alice; but if there is to be one, I think I ought to invite the guests.\n",
    "\n",
    "We gave you the opportunity of doing it, the Red Queen remarked: but I daresay youve not had many lessons in manners yet?\n",
    "\n",
    "Manners are not taught in lessons, said Alice. Lessons teach you to do sums, and things of that sort.\n",
    "\n",
    "And you do Addition? the White Queen asked. Whats one and one and one and one and one and one and one and one and one and one?\n",
    "\n",
    "I dont know, said Alice. I lost count.\n",
    "\n",
    "She cant do Addition, the Red Queen interrupted. Can you do Subtraction? Take nine from eight.\n",
    "\n",
    "Nine from eight I cant, you know, Alice replied very readily: but\n",
    "\n",
    "She cant do Subtraction, said the White Queen. Can you do Division? Divide a loaf by a knifewhats the answer to that?\n",
    "\n",
    "I suppose Alice was beginning, but the Red Queen answered for her. Bread-and-butter, of course. Try another Subtraction sum. Take a bone from a dog: what remains?\n",
    "\n",
    "Alice considered. The bone wouldnt remain, of course, if I took itand the dog wouldnt remain; it would come to bite meand Im sure I shouldnt remain!\n",
    "\n",
    "Then you think nothing would remain? said the Red Queen.\n",
    "\n",
    "I think thats the answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "Wrong, as usual, said the Red Queen: the dogs temper would remain.\n",
    "\n",
    "But I dont see how\n",
    "\n",
    "Why, look here! the Red Queen cried. The dog would lose its temper, wouldnt it?\n",
    "\n",
    "Perhaps it would, Alice replied cautiously.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then if the dog went away, its temper would remain! the Queen exclaimed triumphantly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Alice said, as gravely as she could, They might go different ways. But she couldnt help thinking to herself, What dreadful nonsense we are talking!\n",
    "\n",
    "She cant do sums a bit! the Queens said together, with great emphasis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Can you do sums? Alice said, turning suddenly on the White Queen, for she didnt like being found fault with so much.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Queen gasped and shut her eyes. I can do Addition, if you give me timebut I cant do Subtraction, under any circumstances!\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course you know your A B C? said the Red Queen.\n",
    "\n",
    "To be sure I do. said Alice.\n",
    "\n",
    "So do I, the White Queen whispered: well often say it over together, dear. And Ill tell you a secretI can read words of one letter! Isnt that grand! However, dont be discouraged. Youll come to it in time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here the Red Queen began again. Can you answer useful questions? she said. How is bread made?\n",
    "\n",
    "I know that! Alice cried eagerly. You take some flour\n",
    "\n",
    "Where do you pick the flower? the White Queen asked. In a garden, or in the hedges?\n",
    "\n",
    "Well, it isnt picked at all, Alice explained: its ground\n",
    "\n",
    "How many acres of ground? said the White Queen. You mustnt leave out so many things.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fan her head! the Red Queen anxiously interrupted. Shell be feverish after so much thinking. So they set to work and fanned her with bunches of leaves, till she had to beg them to leave off, it blew her hair about so.\n",
    "\n",
    "Shes all right again now, said the Red Queen. Do you know Languages? Whats the French for fiddle-de-dee?\n",
    "\n",
    "Fiddle-de-dees not English, Alice replied gravely.\n",
    "\n",
    "Who ever said it was? said the Red Queen.\n",
    "\n",
    "Alice thought she saw a way out of the difficulty this time. If youll tell me what language fiddle-de-dee is, Ill tell you the French for it! she exclaimed triumphantly.\n",
    "\n",
    "But the Red Queen drew herself up rather stiffly, and said Queens never make bargains.\n",
    "\n",
    "I wish Queens never asked questions, Alice thought to herself.\n",
    "\n",
    "Dont let us quarrel, the White Queen said in an anxious tone. What is the cause of lightning?\n",
    "\n",
    "The cause of lightning, Alice said very decidedly, for she felt quite certain about this, is the thunderno, no! she hastily corrected herself. I meant the other way.\n",
    "\n",
    "Its too late to correct it, said the Red Queen: when youve once said a thing, that fixes it, and you must take the consequences.\n",
    "\n",
    "Which reminds me the White Queen said, looking down and nervously clasping and unclasping her hands, we had such a thunderstorm last TuesdayI mean one of the last set of Tuesdays, you know.\n",
    "\n",
    "Alice was puzzled. In our country, she remarked, theres only one day at a time.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Red Queen said, Thats a poor thin way of doing things. Now here, we mostly have days and nights two or three at a time, and sometimes in the winter we take as many as five nights togetherfor warmth, you know.\n",
    "\n",
    "Are five nights warmer than one night, then? Alice ventured to ask.\n",
    "\n",
    "Five times as warm, of course.\n",
    "\n",
    "But they should be five times as cold, by the same rule\n",
    "\n",
    "Just so! cried the Red Queen. Five times as warm, and five times as coldjust as Im five times as rich as you are, and five times as clever!\n",
    "\n",
    "Alice sighed and gave it up. Its exactly like a riddle with no answer! she thought.\n",
    "\n",
    "Humpty Dumpty saw it too, the White Queen went on in a low voice, more as if she were talking to herself. He came to the door with a corkscrew in his hand\n",
    "\n",
    "What did he want? said the Red Queen.\n",
    "\n",
    "He said he would come in, the White Queen went on, because he was looking for a hippopotamus. Now, as it happened, there wasnt such a thing in the house, that morning.\n",
    "\n",
    "Is there generally? Alice asked in an astonished tone.\n",
    "\n",
    "Well, only on Thursdays, said the Queen.\n",
    "\n",
    "I know what he came for, said Alice: he wanted to punish the fish, because\n",
    "\n",
    "Here the White Queen began again. It was such a thunderstorm, you cant think! (She never could, you know, said the Red Queen.) And part of the roof came off, and ever so much thunder got inand it went rolling round the room in great lumpsand knocking over the tables and thingstill I was so frightened, I couldnt remember my own name!\n",
    "\n",
    "Alice thought to herself, I never should try to remember my name in the middle of an accident! Where would be the use of it? but she did not say this aloud, for fear of hurting the poor Queens feeling.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your Majesty must excuse her, the Red Queen said to Alice, taking one of the White Queens hands in her own, and gently stroking it: she means well, but she cant help saying foolish things, as a general rule.\n",
    "\n",
    "The White Queen looked timidly at Alice, who felt she ought to say something kind, but really couldnt think of anything at the moment.\n",
    "\n",
    "She never was really well brought up, the Red Queen went on: but its amazing how good-tempered she is! Pat her on the head, and see how pleased shell be! But this was more than Alice had courage to do.\n",
    "\n",
    "A little kindnessand putting her hair in paperswould do wonders with her\n",
    "\n",
    "The White Queen gave a deep sigh, and laid her head on Alices shoulder. I am so sleepy? she moaned.\n",
    "\n",
    "Shes tired, poor thing! said the Red Queen. Smooth her hairlend her your nightcapand sing her a soothing lullaby.\n",
    "\n",
    "I havent got a nightcap with me, said Alice, as she tried to obey the first direction: and I dont know any soothing lullabies.\n",
    "\n",
    "I must do it myself, then, said the Red Queen, and she began:\n",
    "\n",
    "   Hush-a-by lady, in Alices lap!\n",
    "   Till the feasts ready, weve time for a nap:\n",
    "   When the feasts over, well go to the ball\n",
    "   Red Queen, and White Queen, and Alice, and all!\n",
    "\n",
    "And now you know the words, she added, as she put her head down on Alices other shoulder, just sing it through to me. Im getting sleepy, too. In another moment both Queens were fast asleep, and snoring loud.\n",
    "\n",
    "What am I to do? exclaimed Alice, looking about in great perplexity, as first one round head, and then the other, rolled down from her shoulder, and lay like a heavy lump in her lap. I dont think it ever happened before, that any one had to take care of two Queens asleep at once! No, not in all the History of Englandit couldnt, you know, because there never was more than one Queen at a time. Do wake up, you heavy things! she went on in an impatient tone; but there was no answer but a gentle snoring.\n",
    "\n",
    "The snoring got more distinct every minute, and sounded more like a tune: at last she could even make out the words, and she listened so eagerly that, when the two great heads vanished from her lap, she hardly missed them.\n",
    "\n",
    "She was standing before an arched doorway over which were the words QUEEN ALICE in large letters, and on each side of the arch there was a bell-handle; one was marked Visitors Bell, and the other Servants Bell.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ill wait till the songs over, thought Alice, and then Ill ringthewhich bell must I ring? she went on, very much puzzled by the names. Im not a visitor, and Im not a servant. There ought to be one marked Queen, you know\n",
    "\n",
    "Just then the door opened a little way, and a creature with a long beak put its head out for a moment and said No admittance till the week after next! and shut the door again with a bang.\n",
    "\n",
    "Alice knocked and rang in vain for a long time, but at last, a very old Frog, who was sitting under a tree, got up and hobbled slowly towards her: he was dressed in bright yellow, and had enormous boots on.\n",
    "\n",
    "What is it, now? the Frog said in a deep hoarse whisper.\n",
    "\n",
    "Alice turned round, ready to find fault with anybody. Wheres the servant whose business it is to answer the door? she began angrily.\n",
    "\n",
    "Which door? said the Frog.\n",
    "\n",
    "Alice almost stamped with irritation at the slow drawl in which he spoke. This door, of course!\n",
    "\n",
    "The Frog looked at the door with his large dull eyes for a minute: then he went nearer and rubbed it with his thumb, as if he were trying whether the paint would come off; then he looked at Alice.\n",
    "\n",
    "To answer the door? he said. Whats it been asking of? He was so hoarse that Alice could scarcely hear him.\n",
    "\n",
    "I dont know what you mean, she said.\n",
    "\n",
    "I talks English, doesnt I? the Frog went on. Or are you deaf? What did it ask you?\n",
    "\n",
    "Nothing! Alice said impatiently. Ive been knocking at it!\n",
    "\n",
    "Shouldnt do thatshouldnt do that the Frog muttered. Vexes it, you know. Then he went up and gave the door a kick with one of his great feet. You let it alone, he panted out, as he hobbled back to his tree, and itll let you alone, you know.\n",
    "\n",
    "At this moment the door was flung open, and a shrill voice was heard singing:\n",
    "\n",
    "   To the Looking-Glass world it was Alice that said,\n",
    "   Ive a sceptre in hand, Ive a crown on my head;\n",
    "   Let the Looking-Glass creatures, whatever they be,\n",
    "   Come and dine with the Red Queen, the White Queen, and me.\n",
    "\n",
    "And hundreds of voices joined in the chorus:\n",
    "\n",
    "  Then fill up the glasses as quick as you can,\n",
    "  And sprinkle the table with buttons and bran:\n",
    "  Put cats in the coffee, and mice in the tea\n",
    "  And welcome Queen Alice with thirty-times-three!\n",
    "\n",
    "Then followed a confused noise of cheering, and Alice thought to herself, Thirty times three makes ninety. I wonder if any ones counting? In a minute there was silence again, and the same shrill voice sang another verse;\n",
    "\n",
    "  O Looking-Glass creatures, quoth Alice, draw near!\n",
    "  Tis an honour to see me, a favour to hear:\n",
    "  Tis a privilege high to have dinner and tea\n",
    "  Along with the Red Queen, the White Queen, and me!\n",
    "\n",
    "Then came the chorus again:\n",
    "\n",
    "  Then fill up the glasses with treacle and ink,\n",
    "  Or anything else that is pleasant to drink:\n",
    "  Mix sand with the cider, and wool with the wine\n",
    "  And welcome Queen Alice with ninety-times-nine!\n",
    "\n",
    "Ninety times nine! Alice repeated in despair, Oh, thatll never be done! Id better go in at once and there was a dead silence the moment she appeared.\n",
    "\n",
    "Alice glanced nervously along the table, as she walked up the large hall, and noticed that there were about fifty guests, of all kinds: some were animals, some birds, and there were even a few flowers among them. Im glad theyve come without waiting to be asked, she thought: I should never have known who were the right people to invite!\n",
    "\n",
    "There were three chairs at the head of the table; the Red and White Queens had already taken two of them, but the middle one was empty. Alice sat down in it, rather uncomfortable in the silence, and longing for some one to speak.\n",
    "\n",
    "At last the Red Queen began. Youve missed the soup and fish, she said. Put on the joint! And the waiters set a leg of mutton before Alice, who looked at it rather anxiously, as she had never had to carve a joint before.\n",
    "\n",
    "You look a little shy; let me introduce you to that leg of mutton, said the Red Queen. AliceMutton; MuttonAlice. The leg of mutton got up in the dish and made a little bow to Alice; and Alice returned the bow, not knowing whether to be frightened or amused.\n",
    "\n",
    "May I give you a slice? she said, taking up the knife and fork, and looking from one Queen to the other.\n",
    "\n",
    "Certainly not, the Red Queen said, very decidedly: it isnt etiquette to cut any one youve been introduced to. Remove the joint! And the waiters carried it off, and brought a large plum-pudding in its place.\n",
    "\n",
    "I wont be introduced to the pudding, please, Alice said rather hastily, or we shall get no dinner at all. May I give you some?\n",
    "\n",
    "But the Red Queen looked sulky, and growled PuddingAlice; AlicePudding. Remove the pudding! and the waiters took it away so quickly that Alice couldnt return its bow.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, she didnt see why the Red Queen should be the only one to give orders, so, as an experiment, she called out Waiter! Bring back the pudding! and there it was again in a moment like a conjuring-trick. It was so large that she couldnt help feeling a little shy with it, as she had been with the mutton; however, she conquered her shyness by a great effort and cut a slice and handed it to the Red Queen.\n",
    "\n",
    "What impertinence! said the Pudding. I wonder how youd like it, if I were to cut a slice out of you, you creature!\n",
    "\n",
    "It spoke in a thick, suety sort of voice, and Alice hadnt a word to say in reply: she could only sit and look at it and gasp.\n",
    "\n",
    "Make a remark, said the Red Queen: its ridiculous to leave all the conversation to the pudding!\n",
    "\n",
    "Do you know, Ive had such a quantity of poetry repeated to me to-day, Alice began, a little frightened at finding that, the moment she opened her lips, there was dead silence, and all eyes were fixed upon her; and its a very curious thing, I thinkevery poem was about fishes in some way. Do you know why theyre so fond of fishes, all about here?\n",
    "\n",
    "She spoke to the Red Queen, whose answer was a little wide of the mark. As to fishes, she said, very slowly and solemnly, putting her mouth close to Alices ear, her White Majesty knows a lovely riddleall in poetryall about fishes. Shall she repeat it?\n",
    "\n",
    "Her Red Majestys very kind to mention it, the White Queen murmured into Alices other ear, in a voice like the cooing of a pigeon. It would be such a treat! May I?\n",
    "\n",
    "Please do, Alice said very politely.\n",
    "\n",
    "The White Queen laughed with delight, and stroked Alices cheek. Then she began:\n",
    "\n",

    "Take care of yourself! screamed the White Queen, seizing Alices hair with both her hands. Somethings going to happen!\n",

    "And then (as Alice afterwards described it) all sorts of things happened in a moment. The candles all grew up to the ceiling, looking something like a bed of rushes with fireworks at the top. As to the bottles, they each took a pair of plates, which they hastily fitted on as wings, and so, with forks for legs, went fluttering about in all directions: and very like birds they look, Alice thought to herself, as well as she could in the dreadful confusion that was beginning.\n",
    "\n",
    "At this moment she heard a hoarse laugh at her side, and turned to see what was the matter with the White Queen; but, instead of the Queen, there was the leg of mutton sitting in the chair. Here I am! cried a voice from the soup tureen, and Alice turned again, just in time to see the Queens broad good-natured face grinning at her for a moment over the edge of the tureen, before she disappeared into the soup.\n",

    "\n",
    "And as for you, she went on, turning fiercely upon the Red Queen, whom she considered as the cause of all the mischiefbut the Queen was no longer at her sideshe had suddenly dwindled down to the size of a little doll, and was now on the table, merrily running round and round after her own shawl, which was trailing behind her.\n",
    "\n",

    "It is a very inconvenient habit of kittens (Alice had once made the remark) that, whatever you say to them, they always purr. If they would only purr for yes and mew for no, or any rule of that sort, she had said, so that one could keep up a conversation! But how can you talk with a person if they always say the same thing?\n",

    "So Alice hunted among the chessmen on the table till she had found the Red Queen: then she went down on her knees on the hearth-rug, and put the kitten and the Queen to look at each other. Now, Kitty! she cried, clapping her hands triumphantly. Confess that was what you turned into!\n",
    "\n",
    "(But it wouldnt look at it, she said, when she was explaining the thing afterwards to her sister: it turned away its head, and pretended not to see it: but it looked a little ashamed of itself, so I think it must have been the Red Queen.)\n",

    "Sit up a little more stiffly, dear! Alice cried with a merry laugh. And curtsey while youre thinking what towhat to purr. It saves time, remember! And she caught it up and gave it one little kiss, just in honour of having been a Red Queen.\n",

    "Snowdrop, my pet! she went on, looking over her shoulder at the White Kitten, which was still patiently undergoing its toilet, when will Dinah have finished with your White Majesty, I wonder?

    "By the way, Kitty, if only youd been really with me in my dream, there was one thing you would have enjoyedI had such a quantity of poetry said to me, all about fishes! To-morrow morning you shall have a real treat. All the time youre eating your breakfast, Ill repeat The Walrus and the Carpenter to you; and then you can make believe its oysters, dear!\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, Kitty, lets consider who it was that dreamed it all. This is a serious question, my dear, and you should not go on licking your paw like thatas if Dinah hadnt washed you this morning! You see, Kitty, it must have been either me or the Red King. He was part of my dream, of coursebut then I was part of his dream, too! Was it the Red King, Kitty? You were his wife, my dear, so you ought to knowOh, Kitty, do help to settle it! Im sure your paw can wait!

    "the steps which lead up from the hall to this room.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Frequently.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"How often?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Well, some hundreds of times.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Then how many are there?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"How many? I don't know.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Quite so! You have not observed. And yet you have seen. That is\n",
    "just my point. Now, I know that there are seventeen steps,\n",
    "because I have both seen and observed. By-the-way, since you are\n",
    "interested in these little problems, and since you are good\n",
    "enough to chronicle one or two of my trifling experiences, you\n",
    "may be interested in this.\" He threw over a sheet of thick,\n",
    "pink-tinted note-paper which had been lying open upon the table.\n",
    "\"It came by the last post,\" said he. \"Read it aloud.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "The note was undated, and without either signature or address.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"There will call upon you to-night, at a quarter to eight\n",
    "o'clock,\" it said, \"a gentleman who desires to consult you upon a\n",
    "matter of the very deepest moment. Your recent services to one of\n",
    "the royal houses of Europe have shown that you are one who may\n",
    "safely be trusted with matters which are of an importance which\n",
    "can hardly be exaggerated. This account of you we have from all\n",
    "quarters received. Be in your chamber then at that hour, and do\n",
    "not take it amiss if your visitor wear a mask.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"This is indeed a mystery,\" I remarked. \"What do you imagine that\n",
    "it means?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"I have no data yet. It is a capital mistake to theorize before\n",
    "one has data. Insensibly one begins to twist facts to suit\n",
    "theories, instead of theories to suit facts. But the note itself.\n",
    "What do you deduce from it?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "I carefully examined the writing, and the paper upon which it was\n",
    "written.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"The man who wrote it was presumably well to do,\" I remarked,\n",
    "endeavouring to imitate my companion's processes. \"Such paper\n",
    "could not be bought under half a crown a packet. It is peculiarly\n",
    "strong and stiff.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Peculiar--that is the very word,\" said Holmes. \"It is not an\n",
    "English paper at all. Hold it up to the light.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "I did so, and saw a large \"E\" with a small \"g,\" a \"P,\" and a\n",
    "large \"G\" with a small \"t\" woven into the texture of the paper.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"What do you make of that?\" asked Holmes.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"The name of the maker, no doubt; or his monogram, rather.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Not at all. The 'G' with the small 't' stands for\n",
    "'Gesellschaft,' which is the German for 'Company.' It is a\n",
    "customary contraction like our 'Co.' 'P,' of course, stands for\n",
    "'Papier.' Now for the 'Eg.' Let us glance at our Continental\n",
    "Gazetteer.\" He took down a heavy brown volume from his shelves.\n",
    "\"Eglow, Eglonitz--here we are, Egria. It is in a German-speaking\n",
    "country--in Bohemia, not far from Carlsbad. 'Remarkable as being\n",
    "the scene of the death of Wallenstein, and for its numerous\n",
    "glass-factories and paper-mills.' Ha, ha, my boy, what do you\n",
    "make of that?\" His eyes sparkled, and he sent up a great blue\n",
    "triumphant cloud from his cigarette.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"The paper was made in Bohemia,\" I said.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Precisely. And the man who wrote the note is a German. Do you\n",
    "note the peculiar construction of the sentence--'This account of\n",
    "you we have from all quarters received.' A Frenchman or Russian\n",
    "could not have written that. It is the German who is so\n",
    "uncourteous to his verbs. It only remains, therefore, to discover\n",
    "what is wanted by this German who writes upon Bohemian paper and\n",
    "prefers wearing a mask to showing his face. And here he comes, if\n",
    "I am not mistaken, to resolve all our doubts.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "As he spoke there was the sharp sound of horses' hoofs and\n",
    "grating wheels against the curb, followed by a sharp pull at the\n",
    "bell. Holmes whistled.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"A pair, by the sound,\" said he. \"Yes,\" he continued, glancing\n",
    "out of the window. \"A nice little brougham and a pair of\n",
    "beauties. A hundred and fifty guineas apiece. There's money in\n",
    "this case, Watson, if there is nothing else.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"I think that I had better go, Holmes.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Not a bit, Doctor. Stay where you are. I am lost without my\n",
    "Boswell. And this promises to be interesting. It would be a pity\n",
    "to miss it.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"But your client--\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Never mind him. I may want your help, and so may he. Here he\n",
    "comes. Sit down in that armchair, Doctor, and give us your best\n",
    "attention.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "A slow and heavy step, which had been heard upon the stairs and\n",
    "in the passage, paused immediately outside the door. Then there\n",
    "was a loud and authoritative tap.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Come in!\" said Holmes.\n",
    "\n",
    "A man entered who could hardly have been less than six feet six\n",
    "inches in height, with the chest and limbs of a Hercules. His\n",
    "dress was rich with a richness which would, in England, be looked\n",
    "upon as akin to bad taste. Heavy bands of astrakhan were slashed\n",
    "across the sleeves and fronts of his double-breasted coat, while\n",
    "the deep blue cloak which was thrown over his shoulders was lined\n",
    "with flame-coloured silk and secured at the neck with a brooch\n",
    "which consisted of a single flaming beryl. Boots which extended\n",
    "halfway up his calves, and which were trimmed at the tops with\n",
    "rich brown fur, completed the impression of barbaric opulence\n",
    "which was suggested by his whole appearance. He carried a\n",
    "broad-brimmed hat in his hand, while he wore across the upper\n",
    "part of his face, extending down past the cheekbones, a black\n",
    "vizard mask, which he had apparently adjusted that very moment,\n",
    "for his hand was still raised to it as he entered. From the lower\n",
    "part of the face he appeared to be a man of strong character,\n",
    "with a thick, hanging lip, and a long, straight chin suggestive\n",
    "of resolution pushed to the length of obstinacy.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"You had my note?\" he asked with a deep harsh voice and a\n",
    "strongly marked German accent. \"I told you that I would call.\" He\n",
    "looked from one to the other of us, as if uncertain which to\n",
    "address.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Pray take a seat,\" said Holmes. \"This is my friend and\n",
    "colleague, Dr. Watson, who is occasionally good enough to help me\n",
    "in my cases. Whom have I the honour to address?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"You may address me as the Count Von Kramm, a Bohemian nobleman.\n",
    "I understand that this gentleman, your friend, is a man of honour\n",
    "and discretion, whom I may trust with a matter of the most\n",
    "extreme importance. If not, I should much prefer to communicate\n",
    "with you alone.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "I rose to go, but Holmes caught me by the wrist and pushed me\n",
    "back into my chair. \"It is both, or none,\" said he. \"You may say\n",
    "before this gentleman anything which you may say to me.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "The Count shrugged his broad shoulders. \"Then I must begin,\" said\n",
    "he, \"by binding you both to absolute secrecy for two years; at\n",
    "the end of that time the matter will be of no importance. At\n",
    "present it is not too much to say that it is of such weight it\n",
    "may have an influence upon European history.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"I promise,\" said Holmes.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"And I.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"You will excuse this mask,\" continued our strange visitor. \"The\n",
    "august person who employs me wishes his agent to be unknown to\n",
    "you, and I may confess at once that the title by which I have\n",
    "just called myself is not exactly my own.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"I was aware of it,\" said Holmes dryly.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"The circumstances are of great delicacy, and every precaution\n",
    "has to be taken to quench what might grow to be an immense\n",
    "scandal and seriously compromise one of the reigning families of\n",
    "Europe. To speak plainly, the matter implicates the great House\n",
    "of Ormstein, hereditary kings of Bohemia.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"I was also aware of that,\" murmured Holmes, settling himself\n",
    "down in his armchair and closing his eyes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our visitor glanced with some apparent surprise at the languid,\n",
    "lounging figure of the man who had been no doubt depicted to him\n",
    "as the most incisive reasoner and most energetic agent in Europe.\n",
    "Holmes slowly reopened his eyes and looked impatiently at his\n",
    "gigantic client.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"If your Majesty would condescend to state your case,\" he\n",
    "remarked, \"I should be better able to advise you.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "The man sprang from his chair and paced up and down the room in\n",
    "uncontrollable agitation. Then, with a gesture of desperation, he\n",
    "tore the mask from his face and hurled it upon the ground. \"You\n",
    "are right,\" he cried; \"I am the King. Why should I attempt to\n",
    "conceal it?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Why, indeed?\" murmured Holmes. \"Your Majesty had not spoken\n",
    "before I was aware that I was addressing Wilhelm Gottsreich\n",
    "Sigismond von Ormstein, Grand Duke of Cassel-Felstein, and\n",
    "hereditary King of Bohemia.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"But you can understand,\" said our strange visitor, sitting down\n",
    "once more and passing his hand over his high white forehead, \"you\n",
    "can understand that I am not accustomed to doing such business in\n",
    "my own person. Yet the matter was so delicate that I could not\n",
    "confide it to an agent without putting myself in his power. I\n",
    "have come incognito from Prague for the purpose of consulting\n",
    "you.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Then, pray consult,\" said Holmes, shutting his eyes once more.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"The facts are briefly these: Some five years ago, during a\n",
    "lengthy visit to Warsaw, I made the acquaintance of the well-known\n",
    "adventuress, Irene Adler. The name is no doubt familiar to you.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Kindly look her up in my index, Doctor,\" murmured Holmes without\n",
    "opening his eyes. For many years he had adopted a system of\n",
    "docketing all paragraphs concerning men and things, so that it\n",
    "was difficult to name a subject or a person on which he could not\n",
    "at once furnish information. In this case I found her biography\n",
    "sandwiched in between that of a Hebrew rabbi and that of a\n",
    "staff-commander who had written a monograph upon the deep-sea\n",
    "fishes.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Let me see!\" said Holmes. \"Hum! Born in New Jersey in the year\n",
    "1858. Contralto--hum! La Scala, hum! Prima donna Imperial Opera\n",
    "of Warsaw--yes! Retired from operatic stage--ha! Living in\n",
    "London--quite so! Your Majesty, as I understand, became entangled\n",
    "with this young person, wrote her some compromising letters, and\n",
    "is now desirous of getting those letters back.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Precisely so. But how--\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Was there a secret marriage?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"None.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"No legal papers or certificates?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"None.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Then I fail to follow your Majesty. If this young person should\n",
    "produce her letters for blackmailing or other purposes, how is\n",
    "she to prove their authenticity?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"There is the writing.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Pooh, pooh! Forgery.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"My private note-paper.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Stolen.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"My own seal.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Imitated.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"My photograph.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Bought.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"We were both in the photograph.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Oh, dear! That is very bad! Your Majesty has indeed committed an\n",
    "indiscretion.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"I was mad--insane.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"You have compromised yourself seriously.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"I was only Crown Prince then. I was young. I am but thirty now.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"It must be recovered.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"We have tried and failed.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Your Majesty must pay. It must be bought.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"She will not sell.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Stolen, then.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Five attempts have been made. Twice burglars in my pay ransacked\n",
    "her house. Once we diverted her luggage when she travelled. Twice\n",
    "she has been waylaid. There has been no result.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"No sign of it?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Absolutely none.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Holmes laughed. \"It is quite a pretty little problem,\" said he.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"But a very serious one to me,\" returned the King reproachfully.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Very, indeed. And what does she propose to do with the\n",
    "photograph?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"To ruin me.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"But how?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"I am about to be married.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"So I have heard.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"To Clotilde Lothman von Saxe-Meningen, second daughter of the\n",
    "King of Scandinavia. You may know the strict principles of her\n",
    "family. She is herself the very soul of delicacy. A shadow of a\n",
    "doubt as to my conduct would bring the matter to an end.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"And Irene Adler?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Threatens to send them the photograph. And she will do it. I\n",
    "know that she will do it. You do not know her, but she has a soul\n",
    "of steel. She has the face of the most beautiful of women, and\n",
    "the mind of the most resolute of men. Rather than I should marry\n",
    "another woman, there are no lengths to which she would not\n",
    "go--none.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"You are sure that she has not sent it yet?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"I am sure.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"And why?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Because she has said that she would send it on the day when the\n",
    "betrothal was publicly proclaimed. That will be next Monday.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Oh, then we have three days yet,\" said Holmes with a yawn. \"That\n",
    "is very fortunate, as I have one or two matters of importance to\n",
    "look into just at present. Your Majesty will, of course, stay in\n",
    "London for the present?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Certainly. You will find me at the Langham under the name of the\n",
    "Count Von Kramm.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Then I shall drop you a line to let you know how we progress.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Pray do so. I shall be all anxiety.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Then, as to money?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"You have carte blanche.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Absolutely?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"I tell you that I would give one of the provinces of my kingdom\n",
    "to have that photograph.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"And for present expenses?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "The King took a heavy chamois leather bag from under his cloak\n",
    "and laid it on the table.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"There are three hundred pounds in gold and seven hundred in\n",
    "notes,\" he said.\n",
    "\n",
    "Holmes scribbled a receipt upon a sheet of his note-book and\n",
    "handed it to him.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"And Mademoiselle's address?\" he asked.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Is Briony Lodge, Serpentine Avenue, St. John's Wood.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Holmes took a note of it. \"One other question,\" said he. \"Was the\n",
    "photograph a cabinet?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"It was.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Then, good-night, your Majesty, and I trust that we shall soon\n",
    "have some good news for you. And good-night, Watson,\" he added,\n",
    "as the wheels of the royal brougham rolled down the street. \"If\n",
    "you will be good enough to call to-morrow afternoon at three\n",
    "o'clock I should like to chat this little matter over with you.\"\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",
    "\n",
    "bohemia_ch2 = \"\"\"\n",
    "At three o'clock precisely I was at Baker Street, but Holmes had\n",
    "not yet returned. The landlady informed me that he had left the\n",
    "house shortly after eight o'clock in the morning. I sat down\n",
    "beside the fire, however, with the intention of awaiting him,\n",
    "however long he might be. I was already deeply interested in his\n",
    "inquiry, for, though it was surrounded by none of the grim and\n",
    "strange features which were associated with the two crimes which\n",
    "I have already recorded, still, the nature of the case and the\n",
    "exalted station of his client gave it a character of its own.\n",
    "Indeed, apart from the nature of the investigation which my\n",
    "friend had on hand, there was something in his masterly grasp of\n",
    "a situation, and his keen, incisive reasoning, which made it a\n",
    "pleasure to me to study his system of work, and to follow the\n",
    "quick, subtle methods by which he disentangled the most\n",
    "inextricable mysteries. So accustomed was I to his invariable\n",
    "success that the very possibility of his failing had ceased to\n",
    "enter into my head.\n",
    "\n",
    "It was close upon four before the door opened, and a\n",
    "drunken-looking groom, ill-kempt and side-whiskered, with an\n",
    "inflamed face and disreputable clothes, walked into the room.\n",
    "Accustomed as I was to my friend's amazing powers in the use of\n",
    "disguises, I had to look three times before I was certain that it\n",
    "was indeed he. With a nod he vanished into the bedroom, whence he\n",
    "emerged in five minutes tweed-suited and respectable, as of old.\n",
    "Putting his hands into his pockets, he stretched out his legs in\n",
    "front of the fire and laughed heartily for some minutes.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Well, really!\" he cried, and then he choked and laughed again\n",
    "until he was obliged to lie back, limp and helpless, in the\n",
    "chair.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"What is it?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"It's quite too funny. I am sure you could never guess how I\n",
    "employed my morning, or what I ended by doing.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"I can't imagine. I suppose that you have been watching the\n",
    "habits, and perhaps the house, of Miss Irene Adler.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Quite so; but the sequel was rather unusual. I will tell you,\n",
    "however. I left the house a little after eight o'clock this\n",
    "morning in the character of a groom out of work. There is a\n",
    "wonderful sympathy and freemasonry among horsey men. Be one of\n",
    "them, and you will know all that there is to know. I soon found\n",
    "Briony Lodge. It is a bijou villa, with a garden at the back, but\n",
    "built out in front right up to the road, two stories. Chubb lock\n",
    "to the door. Large sitting-room on the right side, well\n",
    "furnished, with long windows almost to the floor, and those\n",
    "preposterous English window fasteners which a child could open.\n",
    "Behind there was nothing remarkable, save that the passage window\n",
    "could be reached from the top of the coach-house. I walked round\n",
    "it and examined it closely from every point of view, but without\n",
    "noting anything else of interest.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"I then lounged down the street and found, as I expected, that\n",
    "there was a mews in a lane which runs down by one wall of the\n",
    "garden. I lent the ostlers a hand in rubbing down their horses,\n",
    "and received in exchange twopence, a glass of half and half, two\n",
    "fills of shag tobacco, and as much information as I could desire\n",
    "about Miss Adler, to say nothing of half a dozen other people in\n",
    "the neighbourhood in whom I was not in the least interested, but\n",
    "whose biographies I was compelled to listen to.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"And what of Irene Adler?\" I asked.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Oh, she has turned all the men's heads down in that part. She is\n",
    "the daintiest thing under a bonnet on this planet. So say the\n",
    "Serpentine-mews, to a man. She lives quietly, sings at concerts,\n",
    "drives out at five every day, and returns at seven sharp for\n",
    "dinner. Seldom goes out at other times, except when she sings.\n",
    "Has only one male visitor, but a good deal of him. He is dark,\n",
    "handsome, and dashing, never calls less than once a day, and\n",
    "often twice. He is a Mr. Godfrey Norton, of the Inner Temple. See\n",
    "the advantages of a cabman as a confidant. They had driven him\n",
    "home a dozen times from Serpentine-mews, and knew all about him.\n",
    "When I had listened to all they had to tell, I began to walk up\n",
    "and down near Briony Lodge once more, and to think over my plan\n",
    "of campaign.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"This Godfrey Norton was evidently an important factor in the\n",
    "matter. He was a lawyer. That sounded ominous. What was the\n",
    "relation between them, and what the object of his repeated\n",
    "visits? Was she his client, his friend, or his mistress? If the\n",
    "former, she had probably transferred the photograph to his\n",
    "keeping. If the latter, it was less likely. On the issue of this\n",
    "question depended whether I should continue my work at Briony\n",
    "Lodge, or turn my attention to the gentleman's chambers in the\n",
    "Temple. It was a delicate point, and it widened the field of my\n",
    "inquiry. I fear that I bore you with these details, but I have to\n",
    "let you see my little difficulties, if you are to understand the\n",
    "situation.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"I am following you closely,\" I answered.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"I was still balancing the matter in my mind when a hansom cab\n",
    "drove up to Briony Lodge, and a gentleman sprang out. He was a\n",
    "remarkably handsome man, dark, aquiline, and moustached--evidently\n",
    "the man of whom I had heard. He appeared to be in a\n",
    "great hurry, shouted to the cabman to wait, and brushed past the\n",
    "maid who opened the door with the air of a man who was thoroughly\n",
    "at home.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"He was in the house about half an hour, and I could catch\n",
    "glimpses of him in the windows of the sitting-room, pacing up and\n",
    "down, talking excitedly, and waving his arms. Of her I could see\n",
    "nothing. Presently he emerged, looking even more flurried than\n",
    "before. As he stepped up to the cab, he pulled a gold watch from\n",
    "his pocket and looked at it earnestly, 'Drive like the devil,' he\n",
    "shouted, 'first to Gross & Hankey's in Regent Street, and then to\n",
    "the Church of St. Monica in the Edgeware Road. Half a guinea if\n",
    "you do it in twenty minutes!'\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Away they went, and I was just wondering whether I should not do\n",
    "well to follow them when up the lane came a neat little landau,\n",
    "the coachman with his coat only half-buttoned, and his tie under\n",
    "his ear, while all the tags of his harness were sticking out of\n",
    "the buckles. It hadn't pulled up before she shot out of the hall\n",
    "door and into it. I only caught a glimpse of her at the moment,\n",
    "but she was a lovely woman, with a face that a man might die for.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"'The Church of St. Monica, John,' she cried, 'and half a\n",
    "sovereign if you reach it in twenty minutes.'\n",
    "\n",
    "\"This was quite too good to lose, Watson. I was just balancing\n",
    "whether I should run for it, or whether I should perch behind her\n",
    "landau when a cab came through the street. The driver looked\n",
    "twice at such a shabby fare, but I jumped in before he could\n",
    "object. 'The Church of St. Monica,' said I, 'and half a sovereign\n",
    "if you reach it in twenty minutes.' It was twenty-five minutes to\n",
    "twelve, and of course it was clear enough what was in the wind.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"My cabby drove fast. I don't think I ever drove faster, but the\n",
    "others were there before us. The cab and the landau with their\n",
    "steaming horses were in front of the door when I arrived. I paid\n",
    "the man and hurried into the church. There was not a soul there\n",
    "save the two whom I had followed and a surpliced clergyman, who\n",
    "seemed to be expostulating with them. They were all three\n",
    "standing in a knot in front of the altar. I lounged up the side\n",
    "aisle like any other idler who has dropped into a church.\n",
    "Suddenly, to my surprise, the three at the altar faced round to\n",
    "me, and Godfrey Norton came running as hard as he could towards\n",
    "me.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"'Thank God,' he cried. 'You'll do. Come! Come!'\n",
    "\n",
    "\"'What then?' I asked.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"'Come, man, come, only three minutes, or it won't be legal.'\n",
    "\n",
    "\"I was half-dragged up to the altar, and before I knew where I was\n",
    "I found myself mumbling responses which were whispered in my ear,\n",
    "and vouching for things of which I knew nothing, and generally\n",
    "assisting in the secure tying up of Irene Adler, spinster, to\n",
    "Godfrey Norton, bachelor. It was all done in an instant, and\n",
    "there was the gentleman thanking me on the one side and the lady\n",
    "on the other, while the clergyman beamed on me in front. It was\n",
    "the most preposterous position in which I ever found myself in my\n",
    "life, and it was the thought of it that started me laughing just\n",
    "now. It seems that there had been some informality about their\n",
    "license, that the clergyman absolutely refused to marry them\n",
    "without a witness of some sort, and that my lucky appearance\n",
    "saved the bridegroom from having to sally out into the streets in\n",
    "search of a best man. The bride gave me a sovereign, and I mean\n",
    "to wear it on my watch-chain in memory of the occasion.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"This is a very unexpected turn of affairs,\" said I; \"and what\n",
    "then?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Well, I found my plans very seriously menaced. It looked as if\n",
    "the pair might take an immediate departure, and so necessitate\n",
    "very prompt and energetic measures on my part. At the church\n",
    "door, however, they separated, he driving back to the Temple, and\n",
    "she to her own house. 'I shall drive out in the park at five as\n",
    "usual,' she said as she left him. I heard no more. They drove\n",
    "away in different directions, and I went off to make my own\n",
    "arrangements.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Which are?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Some cold beef and a glass of beer,\" he answered, ringing the\n",
    "bell. \"I have been too busy to think of food, and I am likely to\n",
    "be busier still this evening. By the way, Doctor, I shall want\n",
    "your co-operation.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"I shall be delighted.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"You don't mind breaking the law?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Not in the least.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Nor running a chance of arrest?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Not in a good cause.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Oh, the cause is excellent!\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Then I am your man.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"I was sure that I might rely on you.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"But what is it you wish?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"When Mrs. Turner has brought in the tray I will make it clear to\n",
    "you. Now,\" he said as he turned hungrily on the simple fare that\n",
    "our landlady had provided, \"I must discuss it while I eat, for I\n",
    "have not much time. It is nearly five now. In two hours we must\n",
    "be on the scene of action. Miss Irene, or Madame, rather, returns\n",
    "from her drive at seven. We must be at Briony Lodge to meet her.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"And what then?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"You must leave that to me. I have already arranged what is to\n",
    "occur. There is only one point on which I must insist. You must\n",
    "not interfere, come what may. You understand?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"I am to be neutral?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"To do nothing whatever. There will probably be some small\n",
    "unpleasantness. Do not join in it. It will end in my being\n",
    "conveyed into the house. Four or five minutes afterwards the\n",
    "sitting-room window will open. You are to station yourself close\n",
    "to that open window.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Yes.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"You are to watch me, for I will be visible to you.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Yes.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"And when I raise my hand--so--you will throw into the room what\n",
    "I give you to throw, and will, at the same time, raise the cry of\n",
    "fire. You quite follow me?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Entirely.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"It is nothing very formidable,\" he said, taking a long cigar-shaped\n",
    "roll from his pocket. \"It is an ordinary plumber's smoke-rocket,\n",
    "fitted with a cap at either end to make it self-lighting.\n",
    "Your task is confined to that. When you raise your cry of fire,\n",
    "it will be taken up by quite a number of people. You may then\n",
    "walk to the end of the street, and I will rejoin you in ten\n",
    "minutes. I hope that I have made myself clear?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"I am to remain neutral, to get near the window, to watch you,\n",
    "and at the signal to throw in this object, then to raise the cry\n",
    "of fire, and to wait you at the corner of the street.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Precisely.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Then you may entirely rely on me.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"That is excellent. I think, perhaps, it is almost time that I\n",
    "prepare for the new role I have to play.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "He disappeared into his bedroom and returned in a few minutes in\n",
    "the character of an amiable and simple-minded Nonconformist\n",
    "clergyman. His broad black hat, his baggy trousers, his white\n",
    "tie, his sympathetic smile, and general look of peering and\n",
    "benevolent curiosity were such as Mr. John Hare alone could have\n",
    "equalled. It was not merely that Holmes changed his costume. His\n",
    "expression, his manner, his very soul seemed to vary with every\n",
    "fresh part that he assumed. The stage lost a fine actor, even as\n",
    "science lost an acute reasoner, when he became a specialist in\n",
    "crime.\n",
    "\n",
    "It was a quarter past six when we left Baker Street, and it still\n",
    "wanted ten minutes to the hour when we found ourselves in\n",
    "Serpentine Avenue. It was already dusk, and the lamps were just\n",
    "being lighted as we paced up and down in front of Briony Lodge,\n",
    "waiting for the coming of its occupant. The house was just such\n",
    "as I had pictured it from Sherlock Holmes' succinct description,\n",
    "but the locality appeared to be less private than I expected. On\n",
    "the contrary, for a small street in a quiet neighbourhood, it was\n",
    "remarkably animated. There was a group of shabbily dressed men\n",
    "smoking and laughing in a corner, a scissors-grinder with his\n",
    "wheel, two guardsmen who were flirting with a nurse-girl, and\n",
    "several well-dressed young men who were lounging up and down with\n",
    "cigars in their mouths.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"You see,\" remarked Holmes, as we paced to and fro in front of\n",
    "the house, \"this marriage rather simplifies matters. The\n",
    "photograph becomes a double-edged weapon now. The chances are\n",
    "that she would be as averse to its being seen by Mr. Godfrey\n",
    "Norton, as our client is to its coming to the eyes of his\n",
    "princess. Now the question is, Where are we to find the\n",
    "photograph?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Where, indeed?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"It is most unlikely that she carries it about with her. It is\n",
    "cabinet size. Too large for easy concealment about a woman's\n",
    "dress. She knows that the King is capable of having her waylaid\n",
    "and searched. Two attempts of the sort have already been made. We\n",
    "may take it, then, that she does not carry it about with her.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Where, then?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Her banker or her lawyer. There is that double possibility. But\n",
    "I am inclined to think neither. Women are naturally secretive,\n",
    "and they like to do their own secreting. Why should she hand it\n",
    "over to anyone else? She could trust her own guardianship, but\n",
    "she could not tell what indirect or political influence might be\n",
    "brought to bear upon a business man. Besides, remember that she\n",
    "had resolved to use it within a few days. It must be where she\n",
    "can lay her hands upon it. It must be in her own house.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"But it has twice been burgled.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Pshaw! They did not know how to look.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"But how will you look?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"I will not look.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"What then?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"I will get her to show me.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"But she will refuse.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"She will not be able to. But I hear the rumble of wheels. It is\n",
    "her carriage. Now carry out my orders to the letter.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "As he spoke the gleam of the side-lights of a carriage came round\n",
    "the curve of the avenue. It was a smart little landau which\n",
    "rattled up to the door of Briony Lodge. As it pulled up, one of\n",
    "the loafing men at the corner dashed forward to open the door in\n",
    "the hope of earning a copper, but was elbowed away by another\n",
    "loafer, who had rushed up with the same intention. A fierce\n",
    "quarrel broke out, which was increased by the two guardsmen, who\n",
    "took sides with one of the loungers, and by the scissors-grinder,\n",
    "who was equally hot upon the other side. A blow was struck, and\n",
    "in an instant the lady, who had stepped from her carriage, was\n",
    "the centre of a little knot of flushed and struggling men, who\n",
    "struck savagely at each other with their fists and sticks. Holmes\n",
    "dashed into the crowd to protect the lady; but just as he reached\n",
    "her he gave a cry and dropped to the ground, with the blood\n",
    "running freely down his face. At his fall the guardsmen took to\n",
    "their heels in one direction and the loungers in the other, while\n",
    "a number of better-dressed people, who had watched the scuffle\n",
    "without taking part in it, crowded in to help the lady and to\n",
    "attend to the injured man. Irene Adler, as I will still call her,\n",
    "had hurried up the steps; but she stood at the top with her\n",
    "superb figure outlined against the lights of the hall, looking\n",
    "back into the street.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Is the poor gentleman much hurt?\" she asked.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"He is dead,\" cried several voices.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"No, no, there's life in him!\" shouted another. \"But he'll be\n",
    "gone before you can get him to hospital.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"He's a brave fellow,\" said a woman. \"They would have had the\n",
    "lady's purse and watch if it hadn't been for him. They were a\n",
    "gang, and a rough one, too. Ah, he's breathing now.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"He can't lie in the street. May we bring him in, marm?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Surely. Bring him into the sitting-room. There is a comfortable\n",
    "sofa. This way, please!\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Slowly and solemnly he was borne into Briony Lodge and laid out\n",
    "in the principal room, while I still observed the proceedings\n",
    "from my post by the window. The lamps had been lit, but the\n",
    "blinds had not been drawn, so that I could see Holmes as he lay\n",
    "upon the couch. I do not know whether he was seized with\n",
    "compunction at that moment for the part he was playing, but I\n",
    "know that I never felt more heartily ashamed of myself in my life\n",
    "than when I saw the beautiful creature against whom I was\n",
    "conspiring, or the grace and kindliness with which she waited\n",
    "upon the injured man. And yet it would be the blackest treachery\n",
    "to Holmes to draw back now from the part which he had intrusted\n",
    "to me. I hardened my heart, and took the smoke-rocket from under\n",
    "my ulster. After all, I thought, we are not injuring her. We are\n",
    "but preventing her from injuring another.\n",
    "\n",
    "Holmes had sat up upon the couch, and I saw him motion like a man\n",
    "who is in need of air. A maid rushed across and threw open the\n",
    "window. At the same instant I saw him raise his hand and at the\n",
    "signal I tossed my rocket into the room with a cry of \"Fire!\" The\n",
    "word was no sooner out of my mouth than the whole crowd of\n",
    "spectators, well dressed and ill--gentlemen, ostlers, and\n",
    "servant-maids--joined in a general shriek of \"Fire!\" Thick clouds\n",
    "of smoke curled through the room and out at the open window. I\n",
    "caught a glimpse of rushing figures, and a moment later the voice\n",
    "of Holmes from within assuring them that it was a false alarm.\n",
    "Slipping through the shouting crowd I made my way to the corner\n",
    "of the street, and in ten minutes was rejoiced to find my\n",
    "friend's arm in mine, and to get away from the scene of uproar.\n",
    "He walked swiftly and in silence for some few minutes until we\n",
    "had turned down one of the quiet streets which lead towards the\n",
    "Edgeware Road.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"You did it very nicely, Doctor,\" he remarked. \"Nothing could\n",
    "have been better. It is all right.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"You have the photograph?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"I know where it is.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"And how did you find out?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"She showed me, as I told you she would.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"I am still in the dark.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"I do not wish to make a mystery,\" said he, laughing. \"The matter\n",
    "was perfectly simple. You, of course, saw that everyone in the\n",
    "street was an accomplice. They were all engaged for the evening.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"I guessed as much.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Then, when the row broke out, I had a little moist red paint in\n",
    "the palm of my hand. I rushed forward, fell down, clapped my hand\n",
    "to my face, and became a piteous spectacle. It is an old trick.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"That also I could fathom.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Then they carried me in. She was bound to have me in. What else\n",
    "could she do? And into her sitting-room, which was the very room\n",
    "which I suspected. It lay between that and her bedroom, and I was\n",
    "determined to see which. They laid me on a couch, I motioned for\n",
    "air, they were compelled to open the window, and you had your\n",
    "chance.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"How did that help you?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"It was all-important. When a woman thinks that her house is on\n",
    "fire, her instinct is at once to rush to the thing which she\n",
    "values most. It is a perfectly overpowering impulse, and I have\n",
    "more than once taken advantage of it. In the case of the\n",
    "Darlington substitution scandal it was of use to me, and also in\n",
    "the Arnsworth Castle business. A married woman grabs at her baby;\n",
    "an unmarried one reaches for her jewel-box. Now it was clear to\n",
    "me that our lady of to-day had nothing in the house more precious\n",
    "to her than what we are in quest of. She would rush to secure it.\n",
    "The alarm of fire was admirably done. The smoke and shouting were\n",
    "enough to shake nerves of steel. She responded beautifully. The\n",
    "photograph is in a recess behind a sliding panel just above the\n",
    "right bell-pull. She was there in an instant, and I caught a\n",
    "glimpse of it as she half-drew it out. When I cried out that it\n",
    "was a false alarm, she replaced it, glanced at the rocket, rushed\n",
    "from the room, and I have not seen her since. I rose, and, making\n",
    "my excuses, escaped from the house. I hesitated whether to\n",
    "attempt to secure the photograph at once; but the coachman had\n",
    "come in, and as he was watching me narrowly it seemed safer to\n",
    "wait. A little over-precipitance may ruin all.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"And now?\" I asked.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Our quest is practically finished. I shall call with the King\n",
    "to-morrow, and with you, if you care to come with us. We will be\n",
    "shown into the sitting-room to wait for the lady, but it is\n",
    "probable that when she comes she may find neither us nor the\n",
    "photograph. It might be a satisfaction to his Majesty to regain\n",
    "it with his own hands.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"And when will you call?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"At eight in the morning. She will not be up, so that we shall\n",
    "have a clear field. Besides, we must be prompt, for this marriage\n",
    "may mean a complete change in her life and habits. I must wire to\n",
    "the King without delay.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "We had reached Baker Street and had stopped at the door. He was\n",
    "searching his pockets for the key when someone passing said:\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Good-night, Mister Sherlock Holmes.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "There were several people on the pavement at the time, but the\n",
    "greeting appeared to come from a slim youth in an ulster who had\n",
    "hurried by.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"I've heard that voice before,\" said Holmes, staring down the\n",
    "dimly lit street. \"Now, I wonder who the deuce that could have\n",
    "been.\"\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",
    "\n",
    "bohemia_ch3 = \"\"\"\n",
    "I slept at Baker Street that night, and we were engaged upon our\n",
    "toast and coffee in the morning when the King of Bohemia rushed\n",
    "into the room.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"You have really got it!\" he cried, grasping Sherlock Holmes by\n",
    "either shoulder and looking eagerly into his face.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Not yet.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"But you have hopes?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"I have hopes.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Then, come. I am all impatience to be gone.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"We must have a cab.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"No, my brougham is waiting.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Then that will simplify matters.\" We descended and started off\n",
    "once more for Briony Lodge.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Irene Adler is married,\" remarked Holmes.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Married! When?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Yesterday.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"But to whom?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"To an English lawyer named Norton.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"But she could not love him.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"I am in hopes that she does.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"And why in hopes?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Because it would spare your Majesty all fear of future\n",
    "annoyance. If the lady loves her husband, she does not love your\n",
    "Majesty. If she does not love your Majesty, there is no reason\n",
    "why she should interfere with your Majesty's plan.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"It is true. And yet--Well! I wish she had been of my own\n",
    "station! What a queen she would have made!\" He relapsed into a\n",
    "moody silence, which was not broken until we drew up in\n",
    "Serpentine Avenue.\n",
    "\n",
    "The door of Briony Lodge was open, and an elderly woman stood\n",
    "upon the steps. She watched us with a sardonic eye as we stepped\n",
    "from the brougham.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Mr. Sherlock Holmes, I believe?\" said she.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"I am Mr. Holmes,\" answered my companion, looking at her with a\n",
    "questioning and rather startled gaze.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Indeed! My mistress told me that you were likely to call. She\n",
    "left this morning with her husband by the 5:15 train from Charing\n",
    "Cross for the Continent.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"What!\" Sherlock Holmes staggered back, white with chagrin and\n",
    "surprise. \"Do you mean that she has left England?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Never to return.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"And the papers?\" asked the King hoarsely. \"All is lost.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"We shall see.\" He pushed past the servant and rushed into the\n",
    "drawing-room, followed by the King and myself. The furniture was\n",
    "scattered about in every direction, with dismantled shelves and\n",
    "open drawers, as if the lady had hurriedly ransacked them before\n",
    "her flight. Holmes rushed at the bell-pull, tore back a small\n",
    "sliding shutter, and, plunging in his hand, pulled out a\n",
    "photograph and a letter. The photograph was of Irene Adler\n",
    "herself in evening dress, the letter was superscribed to\n",
    "\"Sherlock Holmes, Esq. To be left till called for.\" My friend\n",
    "tore it open and we all three read it together. It was dated at\n",
    "midnight of the preceding night and ran in this way:\n",
    "\n",
    "\"MY DEAR MR. SHERLOCK HOLMES,--You really did it very well. You\n",
    "took me in completely. Until after the alarm of fire, I had not a\n",
    "suspicion. But then, when I found how I had betrayed myself, I\n",
    "began to think. I had been warned against you months ago. I had\n",
    "been told that if the King employed an agent it would certainly\n",
    "be you. And your address had been given me. Yet, with all this,\n",
    "you made me reveal what you wanted to know. Even after I became\n",
    "suspicious, I found it hard to think evil of such a dear, kind\n",
    "old clergyman. But, you know, I have been trained as an actress\n",
    "myself. Male costume is nothing new to me. I often take advantage\n",
    "of the freedom which it gives. I sent John, the coachman, to\n",
    "watch you, ran up stairs, got into my walking-clothes, as I call\n",
    "them, and came down just as you departed.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Well, I followed you to your door, and so made sure that I was\n",
    "really an object of interest to the celebrated Mr. Sherlock\n",
    "Holmes. Then I, rather imprudently, wished you good-night, and\n",
    "started for the Temple to see my husband.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"We both thought the best resource was flight, when pursued by\n",
    "so formidable an antagonist; so you will find the nest empty when\n",
    "you call to-morrow. As to the photograph, your client may rest in\n",
    "peace. I love and am loved by a better man than he. The King may\n",
    "do what he will without hindrance from one whom he has cruelly\n",
    "wronged. I keep it only to safeguard myself, and to preserve a\n",
    "weapon which will always secure me from any steps which he might\n",
    "take in the future. I leave a photograph which he might care to\n",
    "possess; and I remain, dear Mr. Sherlock Holmes,\n",

    "to a more successful conclusion.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"On the contrary, my dear sir,\" cried the King; \"nothing could be\n",

    "few and simple, so that in less than the time stated I was in a\n",
    "cab with my valise, rattling away to Paddington Station. Sherlock\n",
    "Holmes was pacing up and down the platform, his tall, gaunt\n",

    "\"Boscombe Valley is a country district not very far from Ross, in\n",
    "Herefordshire. The largest landed proprietor in that part is a\n",
    "Mr. John Turner, who made his money in Australia and returned\n",
    "some years ago to the old country. One of the farms which he\n",
    "held, that of Hatherley, was let to Mr. Charles McCarthy, who was\n",
    "also an ex-Australian. The men had known each other in the\n",
    "colonies, so that it was not unnatural that when they came to\n",
    "settle down they should do so as near each other as possible.\n",
    "Turner was apparently the richer man, so McCarthy became his\n",
    "tenant but still remained, it seems, upon terms of perfect\n",
    "equality, as they were frequently together. McCarthy had one son,\n",
    "a lad of eighteen, and Turner had an only daughter of the same\n",
    "age, but neither of them had wives living. They appear to have\n",
    "avoided the society of the neighbouring English families and to\n",
    "have led retired lives, though both the McCarthys were fond of\n",
    "sport and were frequently seen at the race-meetings of the\n",
    "neighbourhood. McCarthy kept two servants--a man and a girl.\n",
    "Turner had a considerable household, some half-dozen at the\n",
    "least. That is as much as I have been able to gather about the\n",
    "families. Now for the facts.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"On June 3rd, that is, on Monday last, McCarthy left his house at\n",
    "Hatherley about three in the afternoon and walked down to the\n",
    "Boscombe Pool, which is a small lake formed by the spreading out\n",
    "of the stream which runs down the Boscombe Valley. He had been\n",
    "out with his serving-man in the morning at Ross, and he had told\n",
    "the man that he must hurry, as he had an appointment of\n",
    "importance to keep at three. From that appointment he never came\n",
    "back alive.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"From Hatherley Farm-house to the Boscombe Pool is a quarter of a\n",
    "mile, and two people saw him as he passed over this ground. One\n",
    "was an old woman, whose name is not mentioned, and the other was\n",
    "William Crowder, a game-keeper in the employ of Mr. Turner. Both\n",
    "these witnesses depose that Mr. McCarthy was walking alone. The\n",
    "game-keeper adds that within a few minutes of his seeing Mr.\n",
    "McCarthy pass he had seen his son, Mr. James McCarthy, going the\n",
    "same way with a gun under his arm. To the best of his belief, the\n",
    "father was actually in sight at the time, and the son was\n",
    "following him. He thought no more of the matter until he heard in\n",
    "the evening of the tragedy that had occurred.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"The two McCarthys were seen after the time when William Crowder,\n",
    "the game-keeper, lost sight of them. The Boscombe Pool is thickly\n",
    "wooded round, with just a fringe of grass and of reeds round the\n",
    "edge. A girl of fourteen, Patience Moran, who is the daughter of\n",
    "the lodge-keeper of the Boscombe Valley estate, was in one of the\n",
    "woods picking flowers. She states that while she was there she\n",
    "saw, at the border of the wood and close by the lake, Mr.\n",
    "McCarthy and his son, and that they appeared to be having a\n",
    "violent quarrel. She heard Mr. McCarthy the elder using very\n",
    "strong language to his son, and she saw the latter raise up his\n",
    "hand as if to strike his father. She was so frightened by their\n",
    "violence that she ran away and told her mother when she reached\n",
    "home that she had left the two McCarthys quarrelling near\n",
    "Boscombe Pool, and that she was afraid that they were going to\n",
    "fight. She had hardly said the words when young Mr. McCarthy came\n",
    "running up to the lodge to say that he had found his father dead\n",
    "in the wood, and to ask for the help of the lodge-keeper. He was\n",
    "much excited, without either his gun or his hat, and his right\n",
    "hand and sleeve were observed to be stained with fresh blood. On\n",
    "following him they found the dead body stretched out upon the\n",
    "grass beside the pool. The head had been beaten in by repeated\n",
    "blows of some heavy and blunt weapon. The injuries were such as\n",
    "might very well have been inflicted by the butt-end of his son's\n",
    "gun, which was found lying on the grass within a few paces of the\n",
    "body. Under these circumstances the young man was instantly\n",
    "arrested, and a verdict of 'wilful murder' having been returned\n",
    "at the inquest on Tuesday, he was on Wednesday brought before the\n",
    "magistrates at Ross, who have referred the case to the next\n",
    "Assizes. Those are the main facts of the case as they came out\n",
    "before the coroner and the police-court.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"I could hardly imagine a more damning case,\" I remarked. \"If\n",
    "ever circumstantial evidence pointed to a criminal it does so\n",
    "here.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Circumstantial evidence is a very tricky thing,\" answered Holmes\n",
    "thoughtfully. \"It may seem to point very straight to one thing,\n",
    "but if you shift your own point of view a little, you may find it\n",
    "pointing in an equally uncompromising manner to something\n",
    "entirely different. It must be confessed, however, that the case\n",
    "looks exceedingly grave against the young man, and it is very\n",
    "possible that he is indeed the culprit. There are several people\n",
    "in the neighbourhood, however, and among them Miss Turner, the\n",
    "daughter of the neighbouring landowner, who believe in his\n",
    "innocence, and who have retained Lestrade, whom you may recollect\n",
    "in connection with the Study in Scarlet, to work out the case in\n",
    "his interest. Lestrade, being rather puzzled, has referred the\n",
    "case to me, and hence it is that two middle-aged gentlemen are\n",
    "flying westward at fifty miles an hour instead of quietly\n",
    "digesting their breakfasts at home.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"I am afraid,\" said I, \"that the facts are so obvious that you\n",
    "will find little credit to be gained out of this case.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"There is nothing more deceptive than an obvious fact,\" he\n",
    "answered, laughing. \"Besides, we may chance to hit upon some\n",
    "other obvious facts which may have been by no means obvious to\n",
    "Mr. Lestrade. You know me too well to think that I am boasting\n",
    "when I say that I shall either confirm or destroy his theory by\n",
    "means which he is quite incapable of employing, or even of\n",
    "understanding. To take the first example to hand, I very clearly\n",
    "perceive that in your bedroom the window is upon the right-hand\n",
    "side, and yet I question whether Mr. Lestrade would have noted\n",
    "even so self-evident a thing as that.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"How on earth--\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"My dear fellow, I know you well. I know the military neatness\n",
    "which characterises you. You shave every morning, and in this\n",
    "season you shave by the sunlight; but since your shaving is less\n",
    "and less complete as we get farther back on the left side, until\n",
    "it becomes positively slovenly as we get round the angle of the\n",
    "jaw, it is surely very clear that that side is less illuminated\n",
    "than the other. I could not imagine a man of your habits looking\n",
    "at himself in an equal light and being satisfied with such a\n",
    "result. I only quote this as a trivial example of observation and\n",
    "inference. Therein lies my mtier, and it is just possible that\n",
    "it may be of some service in the investigation which lies before\n",
    "us. There are one or two minor points which were brought out in\n",
    "the inquest, and which are worth considering.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"What are they?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"It appears that his arrest did not take place at once, but after\n",
    "the return to Hatherley Farm. On the inspector of constabulary\n",
    "informing him that he was a prisoner, he remarked that he was not\n",
    "surprised to hear it, and that it was no more than his deserts.\n",
    "This observation of his had the natural effect of removing any\n",
    "traces of doubt which might have remained in the minds of the\n",
    "coroner's jury.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"It was a confession,\" I ejaculated.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"No, for it was followed by a protestation of innocence.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Coming on the top of such a damning series of events, it was at\n",
    "least a most suspicious remark.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"On the contrary,\" said Holmes, \"it is the brightest rift which I\n",
    "can at present see in the clouds. However innocent he might be,\n",
    "he could not be such an absolute imbecile as not to see that the\n",
    "circumstances were very black against him. Had he appeared\n",
    "surprised at his own arrest, or feigned indignation at it, I\n",
    "should have looked upon it as highly suspicious, because such\n",
    "surprise or anger would not be natural under the circumstances,\n",
    "and yet might appear to be the best policy to a scheming man. His\n",
    "frank acceptance of the situation marks him as either an innocent\n",
    "man, or else as a man of considerable self-restraint and\n",
    "firmness. As to his remark about his deserts, it was also not\n",
    "unnatural if you consider that he stood beside the dead body of\n",
    "his father, and that there is no doubt that he had that very day\n",
    "so far forgotten his filial duty as to bandy words with him, and\n",
    "even, according to the little girl whose evidence is so\n",
    "important, to raise his hand as if to strike him. The\n",
    "self-reproach and contrition which are displayed in his remark\n",
    "appear to me to be the signs of a healthy mind rather than of a\n",
    "guilty one.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "I shook my head. \"Many men have been hanged on far slighter\n",
    "evidence,\" I remarked.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"So they have. And many men have been wrongfully hanged.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"What is the young man's own account of the matter?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"It is, I am afraid, not very encouraging to his supporters,\n",
    "though there are one or two points in it which are suggestive.\n",
    "You will find it here, and may read it for yourself.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "He picked out from his bundle a copy of the local Herefordshire\n",
    "paper, and having turned down the sheet he pointed out the\n",
    "paragraph in which the unfortunate young man had given his own\n",
    "statement of what had occurred. I settled myself down in the\n",
    "corner of the carriage and read it very carefully. It ran in this\n",
    "way:\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Mr. James McCarthy, the only son of the deceased, was then called\n",
    "and gave evidence as follows: 'I had been away from home for\n",
    "three days at Bristol, and had only just returned upon the\n",
    "morning of last Monday, the 3rd. My father was absent from home at\n",
    "the time of my arrival, and I was informed by the maid that he\n",
    "had driven over to Ross with John Cobb, the groom. Shortly after\n",
    "my return I heard the wheels of his trap in the yard, and,\n",
    "looking out of my window, I saw him get out and walk rapidly out\n",
    "of the yard, though I was not aware in which direction he was\n",
    "going. I then took my gun and strolled out in the direction of\n",
    "the Boscombe Pool, with the intention of visiting the rabbit\n",
    "warren which is upon the other side. On my way I saw William\n",
    "Crowder, the game-keeper, as he had stated in his evidence; but\n",
    "he is mistaken in thinking that I was following my father. I had\n",
    "no idea that he was in front of me. When about a hundred yards\n",
    "from the pool I heard a cry of \"Cooee!\" which was a usual signal\n",
    "between my father and myself. I then hurried forward, and found\n",
    "him standing by the pool. He appeared to be much surprised at\n",
    "seeing me and asked me rather roughly what I was doing there. A\n",
    "conversation ensued which led to high words and almost to blows,\n",
    "for my father was a man of a very violent temper. Seeing that his\n",
    "passion was becoming ungovernable, I left him and returned\n",
    "towards Hatherley Farm. I had not gone more than 150 yards,\n",
    "however, when I heard a hideous outcry behind me, which caused me\n",
    "to run back again. I found my father expiring upon the ground,\n",
    "with his head terribly injured. I dropped my gun and held him in\n",
    "my arms, but he almost instantly expired. I knelt beside him for\n",
    "some minutes, and then made my way to Mr. Turner's lodge-keeper,\n",
    "his house being the nearest, to ask for assistance. I saw no one\n",
    "near my father when I returned, and I have no idea how he came by\n",
    "his injuries. He was not a popular man, being somewhat cold and\n",
    "forbidding in his manners, but he had, as far as I know, no\n",
    "active enemies. I know nothing further of the matter.'\n",
    "\n",

    "allusion to a rat.\n",

    "\"This concluded the examination of the witness.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"I see,\" said I as I glanced down the column, \"that the coroner\n",
    "in his concluding remarks was rather severe upon young McCarthy.\n",
    "He calls attention, and with reason, to the discrepancy about his\n",
    "father having signalled to him before seeing him, also to his\n",
    "refusal to give details of his conversation with his father, and\n",
    "his singular account of his father's dying words. They are all,\n",
    "as he remarks, very much against the son.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Holmes laughed softly to himself and stretched himself out upon\n",
    "the cushioned seat. \"Both you and the coroner have been at some\n",
    "pains,\" said he, \"to single out the very strongest points in the\n",
    "young man's favour. Don't you see that you alternately give him\n",
    "credit for having too much imagination and too little? Too\n",
    "little, if he could not invent a cause of quarrel which would\n",
    "give him the sympathy of the jury; too much, if he evolved from\n",
    "his own inner consciousness anything so outr as a dying\n",
    "reference to a rat, and the incident of the vanishing cloth. No,\n",
    "sir, I shall approach this case from the point of view that what\n",
    "this young man says is true, and we shall see whither that\n",
    "hypothesis will lead us. And now here is my pocket Petrarch, and\n",
    "not another word shall I say of this case until we are on the\n",
    "scene of action. We lunch at Swindon, and I see that we shall be\n",
    "there in twenty minutes.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "It was nearly four o'clock when we at last, after passing through\n",
    "the beautiful Stroud Valley, and over the broad gleaming Severn,\n",
    "found ourselves at the pretty little country-town of Ross. A\n",
    "lean, ferret-like man, furtive and sly-looking, was waiting for\n",
    "us upon the platform. In spite of the light brown dustcoat and\n",
    "leather-leggings which he wore in deference to his rustic\n",
    "surroundings, I had no difficulty in recognising Lestrade, of\n",
    "Scotland Yard. With him we drove to the Hereford Arms where a\n",
    "room had already been engaged for us.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"I have ordered a carriage,\" said Lestrade as we sat over a cup\n",
    "of tea. \"I knew your energetic nature, and that you would not be\n",
    "happy until you had been on the scene of the crime.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"It was very nice and complimentary of you,\" Holmes answered. \"It\n",
    "is entirely a question of barometric pressure.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Lestrade looked startled. \"I do not quite follow,\" he said.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"How is the glass? Twenty-nine, I see. No wind, and not a cloud\n",
    "in the sky. I have a caseful of cigarettes here which need\n",
    "smoking, and the sofa is very much superior to the usual country\n",
    "hotel abomination. I do not think that it is probable that I\n",
    "shall use the carriage to-night.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Lestrade laughed indulgently. \"You have, no doubt, already formed\n",
    "your conclusions from the newspapers,\" he said. \"The case is as\n",
    "plain as a pikestaff, and the more one goes into it the plainer\n",
    "it becomes. Still, of course, one can't refuse a lady, and such a\n",
    "very positive one, too. She has heard of you, and would have your\n",
    "opinion, though I repeatedly told her that there was nothing\n",
    "which you could do which I had not already done. Why, bless my\n",
    "soul! here is her carriage at the door.\"\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",

    "He had hardly spoken before there rushed into the room one of the\n",
    "most lovely young women that I have ever seen in my life. Her\n",
    "violet eyes shining, her lips parted, a pink flush upon her\n",
    "cheeks, all thought of her natural reserve lost in her\n",
    "overpowering excitement and concern.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Oh, Mr. Sherlock Holmes!\" she cried, glancing from one to the\n",
    "other of us, and finally, with a woman's quick intuition,\n",
    "fastening upon my companion, \"I am so glad that you have come. I\n",
    "have driven down to tell you so. I know that James didn't do it.\n",
    "I know it, and I want you to start upon your work knowing it,\n",
    "too. Never let yourself doubt upon that point. We have known each\n",
    "other since we were little children, and I know his faults as no\n",
    "one else does; but he is too tender-hearted to hurt a fly. Such a\n",
    "charge is absurd to anyone who really knows him.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"I hope we may clear him, Miss Turner,\" said Sherlock Holmes.\n",
    "\"You may rely upon my doing all that I can.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"But you have read the evidence. You have formed some conclusion?\n",
    "Do you not see some loophole, some flaw? Do you not yourself\n",
    "think that he is innocent?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"I think that it is very probable.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"There, now!\" she cried, throwing back her head and looking\n",
    "defiantly at Lestrade. \"You hear! He gives me hopes.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Lestrade shrugged his shoulders. \"I am afraid that my colleague\n",
    "has been a little quick in forming his conclusions,\" he said.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"But he is right. Oh! I know that he is right. James never did\n",
    "it. And about his quarrel with his father, I am sure that the\n",
    "reason why he would not speak about it to the coroner was because\n",
    "I was concerned in it.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"In what way?\" asked Holmes.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"It is no time for me to hide anything. James and his father had\n",
    "many disagreements about me. Mr. McCarthy was very anxious that\n",
    "there should be a marriage between us. James and I have always\n",
    "loved each other as brother and sister; but of course he is young\n",
    "and has seen very little of life yet, and--and--well, he\n",
    "naturally did not wish to do anything like that yet. So there\n",
    "were quarrels, and this, I am sure, was one of them.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"And your father?\" asked Holmes. \"Was he in favour of such a\n",
    "union?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"No, he was averse to it also. No one but Mr. McCarthy was in\n",
    "favour of it.\" A quick blush passed over her fresh young face as\n",
    "Holmes shot one of his keen, questioning glances at her.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Thank you for this information,\" said he. \"May I see your father\n",
    "if I call to-morrow?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"I am afraid the doctor won't allow it.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"The doctor?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Yes, have you not heard? Poor father has never been strong for\n",
    "years back, but this has broken him down completely. He has taken\n",
    "to his bed, and Dr. Willows says that he is a wreck and that his\n",
    "nervous system is shattered. Mr. McCarthy was the only man alive\n",
    "who had known dad in the old days in Victoria.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Ha! In Victoria! That is important.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Yes, at the mines.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Quite so; at the gold-mines, where, as I understand, Mr. Turner\n",
    "made his money.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Yes, certainly.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Thank you, Miss Turner. You have been of material assistance to\n",
    "me.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"You will tell me if you have any news to-morrow. No doubt you\n",
    "will go to the prison to see James. Oh, if you do, Mr. Holmes, do\n",
    "tell him that I know him to be innocent.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"I will, Miss Turner.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"I must go home now, for dad is very ill, and he misses me so if\n",
    "I leave him. Good-bye, and God help you in your undertaking.\" She\n",
    "hurried from the room as impulsively as she had entered, and we\n",
    "heard the wheels of her carriage rattle off down the street.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"I am ashamed of you, Holmes,\" said Lestrade with dignity after a\n",
    "few minutes' silence. \"Why should you raise up hopes which you\n",
    "are bound to disappoint? I am not over-tender of heart, but I\n",
    "call it cruel.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"I think that I see my way to clearing James McCarthy,\" said\n",
    "Holmes. \"Have you an order to see him in prison?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Yes, but only for you and me.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Then I shall reconsider my resolution about going out. We have\n",
    "still time to take a train to Hereford and see him to-night?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Ample.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Then let us do so. Watson, I fear that you will find it very\n",
    "slow, but I shall only be away a couple of hours.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "I walked down to the station with them, and then wandered through\n",
    "the streets of the little town, finally returning to the hotel,\n",
    "where I lay upon the sofa and tried to interest myself in a\n",
    "yellow-backed novel. The puny plot of the story was so thin,\n",
    "however, when compared to the deep mystery through which we were\n",
    "groping, and I found my attention wander so continually from the\n",
    "action to the fact, that I at last flung it across the room and\n",
    "gave myself up entirely to a consideration of the events of the\n",
    "day. Supposing that this unhappy young man's story were\n",
    "absolutely true, then what hellish thing, what absolutely\n",
    "unforeseen and extraordinary calamity could have occurred between\n",
    "the time when he parted from his father, and the moment when,\n",
    "drawn back by his screams, he rushed into the glade? It was\n",
    "something terrible and deadly. What could it be? Might not the\n",
    "nature of the injuries reveal something to my medical instincts?\n",
    "I rang the bell and called for the weekly county paper, which\n",
    "contained a verbatim account of the inquest. In the surgeon's\n",
    "deposition it was stated that the posterior third of the left\n",
    "parietal bone and the left half of the occipital bone had been\n",
    "shattered by a heavy blow from a blunt weapon. I marked the spot\n",
    "upon my own head. Clearly such a blow must have been struck from\n",
    "behind. That was to some extent in favour of the accused, as when\n",
    "seen quarrelling he was face to face with his father. Still, it\n",
    "did not go for very much, for the older man might have turned his\n",
    "back before the blow fell. Still, it might be worth while to call\n",
    "Holmes' attention to it. Then there was the peculiar dying\n",
    "reference to a rat. What could that mean? It could not be\n",
    "delirium. A man dying from a sudden blow does not commonly become\n",
    "delirious. No, it was more likely to be an attempt to explain how\n",
    "he met his fate. But what could it indicate? I cudgelled my\n",
    "brains to find some possible explanation. And then the incident\n",
    "of the grey cloth seen by young McCarthy. If that were true the\n",
    "murderer must have dropped some part of his dress, presumably his\n",
    "overcoat, in his flight, and must have had the hardihood to\n",
    "return and to carry it away at the instant when the son was\n",
    "kneeling with his back turned not a dozen paces off. What a\n",
    "tissue of mysteries and improbabilities the whole thing was! I\n",
    "did not wonder at Lestrade's opinion, and yet I had so much faith\n",
    "in Sherlock Holmes' insight that I could not lose hope as long\n",
    "as every fresh fact seemed to strengthen his conviction of young\n",
    "McCarthy's innocence.\n",
    "\n",
    "It was late before Sherlock Holmes returned. He came back alone,\n",
    "for Lestrade was staying in lodgings in the town.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"The glass still keeps very high,\" he remarked as he sat down.\n",
    "\"It is of importance that it should not rain before we are able\n",
    "to go over the ground. On the other hand, a man should be at his\n",
    "very best and keenest for such nice work as that, and I did not\n",
    "wish to do it when fagged by a long journey. I have seen young\n",
    "McCarthy.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"And what did you learn from him?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Nothing.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Could he throw no light?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"None at all. I was inclined to think at one time that he knew\n",
    "who had done it and was screening him or her, but I am convinced\n",
    "now that he is as puzzled as everyone else. He is not a very\n",
    "quick-witted youth, though comely to look at and, I should think,\n",
    "sound at heart.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"I cannot admire his taste,\" I remarked, \"if it is indeed a fact\n",
    "that he was averse to a marriage with so charming a young lady as\n",
    "this Miss Turner.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Ah, thereby hangs a rather painful tale. This fellow is madly,\n",
    "insanely, in love with her, but some two years ago, when he was\n",
    "only a lad, and before he really knew her, for she had been away\n",
    "five years at a boarding-school, what does the idiot do but get\n",
    "into the clutches of a barmaid in Bristol and marry her at a\n",
    "registry office? No one knows a word of the matter, but you can\n",
    "imagine how maddening it must be to him to be upbraided for not\n",
    "doing what he would give his very eyes to do, but what he knows\n",
    "to be absolutely impossible. It was sheer frenzy of this sort\n",
    "which made him throw his hands up into the air when his father,\n",
    "at their last interview, was goading him on to propose to Miss\n",
    "Turner. On the other hand, he had no means of supporting himself,\n",
    "and his father, who was by all accounts a very hard man, would\n",
    "have thrown him over utterly had he known the truth. It was with\n",
    "his barmaid wife that he had spent the last three days in\n",
    "Bristol, and his father did not know where he was. Mark that\n",
    "point. It is of importance. Good has come out of evil, however,\n",
    "for the barmaid, finding from the papers that he is in serious\n",
    "trouble and likely to be hanged, has thrown him over utterly and\n",
    "has written to him to say that she has a husband already in the\n",
    "Bermuda Dockyard, so that there is really no tie between them. I\n",
    "think that that bit of news has consoled young McCarthy for all\n",
    "that he has suffered.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"But if he is innocent, who has done it?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Ah! who? I would call your attention very particularly to two\n",
    "points. One is that the murdered man had an appointment with\n",
    "someone at the pool, and that the someone could not have been his\n",
    "son, for his son was away, and he did not know when he would\n",
    "return. The second is that the murdered man was heard to cry\n",
    "'Cooee!' before he knew that his son had returned. Those are the\n",
    "crucial points upon which the case depends. And now let us talk\n",
    "about George Meredith, if you please, and we shall leave all\n",
    "minor matters until to-morrow.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "There was no rain, as Holmes had foretold, and the morning broke\n",
    "bright and cloudless. At nine o'clock Lestrade called for us with\n",
    "the carriage, and we set off for Hatherley Farm and the Boscombe\n",
    "Pool.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"There is serious news this morning,\" Lestrade observed. \"It is\n",
    "said that Mr. Turner, of the Hall, is so ill that his life is\n",
    "despaired of.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"An elderly man, I presume?\" said Holmes.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"About sixty; but his constitution has been shattered by his life\n",
    "abroad, and he has been in failing health for some time. This\n",
    "business has had a very bad effect upon him. He was an old friend\n",
    "of McCarthy's, and, I may add, a great benefactor to him, for I\n",
    "have learned that he gave him Hatherley Farm rent free.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Indeed! That is interesting,\" said Holmes.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Oh, yes! In a hundred other ways he has helped him. Everybody\n",
    "about here speaks of his kindness to him.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Really! Does it not strike you as a little singular that this\n",
    "McCarthy, who appears to have had little of his own, and to have\n",
    "been under such obligations to Turner, should still talk of\n",
    "marrying his son to Turner's daughter, who is, presumably,\n",
    "heiress to the estate, and that in such a very cocksure manner,\n",
    "as if it were merely a case of a proposal and all else would\n",
    "follow? It is the more strange, since we know that Turner himself\n",
    "was averse to the idea. The daughter told us as much. Do you not\n",
    "deduce something from that?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"We have got to the deductions and the inferences,\" said\n",
    "Lestrade, winking at me. \"I find it hard enough to tackle facts,\n",
    "Holmes, without flying away after theories and fancies.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"You are right,\" said Holmes demurely; \"you do find it very hard\n",
    "to tackle the facts.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Anyhow, I have grasped one fact which you seem to find it\n",
    "difficult to get hold of,\" replied Lestrade with some warmth.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"And that is--\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"That McCarthy senior met his death from McCarthy junior and that\n",
    "all theories to the contrary are the merest moonshine.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Well, moonshine is a brighter thing than fog,\" said Holmes,\n",
    "laughing. \"But I am very much mistaken if this is not Hatherley\n",
    "Farm upon the left.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Yes, that is it.\" It was a widespread, comfortable-looking\n",
    "building, two-storied, slate-roofed, with great yellow blotches\n",
    "of lichen upon the grey walls. The drawn blinds and the smokeless\n",
    "chimneys, however, gave it a stricken look, as though the weight\n",
    "of this horror still lay heavy upon it. We called at the door,\n",
    "when the maid, at Holmes' request, showed us the boots which her\n",
    "master wore at the time of his death, and also a pair of the\n",
    "son's, though not the pair which he had then had. Having measured\n",
    "these very carefully from seven or eight different points, Holmes\n",
    "desired to be led to the court-yard, from which we all followed\n",
    "the winding track which led to Boscombe Pool.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sherlock Holmes was transformed when he was hot upon such a scent\n",
    "as this. Men who had only known the quiet thinker and logician of\n",
    "Baker Street would have failed to recognise him. His face flushed\n",
    "and darkened. His brows were drawn into two hard black lines,\n",
    "while his eyes shone out from beneath them with a steely glitter.\n",
    "His face was bent downward, his shoulders bowed, his lips\n",
    "compressed, and the veins stood out like whipcord in his long,\n",
    "sinewy neck. His nostrils seemed to dilate with a purely animal\n",
    "lust for the chase, and his mind was so absolutely concentrated\n",
    "upon the matter before him that a question or remark fell\n",
    "unheeded upon his ears, or, at the most, only provoked a quick,\n",
    "impatient snarl in reply. Swiftly and silently he made his way\n",
    "along the track which ran through the meadows, and so by way of\n",
    "the woods to the Boscombe Pool. It was damp, marshy ground, as is\n",
    "all that district, and there were marks of many feet, both upon\n",
    "the path and amid the short grass which bounded it on either\n",
    "side. Sometimes Holmes would hurry on, sometimes stop dead, and\n",
    "once he made quite a little detour into the meadow. Lestrade and\n",
    "I walked behind him, the detective indifferent and contemptuous,\n",
    "while I watched my friend with the interest which sprang from the\n",
    "conviction that every one of his actions was directed towards a\n",
    "definite end.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Boscombe Pool, which is a little reed-girt sheet of water\n",
    "some fifty yards across, is situated at the boundary between the\n",
    "Hatherley Farm and the private park of the wealthy Mr. Turner.\n",
    "Above the woods which lined it upon the farther side we could see\n",
    "the red, jutting pinnacles which marked the site of the rich\n",
    "landowner's dwelling. On the Hatherley side of the pool the woods\n",
    "grew very thick, and there was a narrow belt of sodden grass\n",
    "twenty paces across between the edge of the trees and the reeds\n",
    "which lined the lake. Lestrade showed us the exact spot at which\n",
    "the body had been found, and, indeed, so moist was the ground,\n",
    "that I could plainly see the traces which had been left by the\n",
    "fall of the stricken man. To Holmes, as I could see by his eager\n",
    "face and peering eyes, very many other things were to be read\n",
    "upon the trampled grass. He ran round, like a dog who is picking\n",
    "up a scent, and then turned upon my companion.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"What did you go into the pool for?\" he asked.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"I fished about with a rake. I thought there might be some weapon\n",
    "or other trace. But how on earth--\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Oh, tut, tut! I have no time! That left foot of yours with its\n",
    "inward twist is all over the place. A mole could trace it, and\n",
    "there it vanishes among the reeds. Oh, how simple it would all\n",
    "have been had I been here before they came like a herd of buffalo\n",
    "and wallowed all over it. Here is where the party with the\n",
    "lodge-keeper came, and they have covered all tracks for six or\n",
    "eight feet round the body. But here are three separate tracks of\n",
    "the same feet.\" He drew out a lens and lay down upon his\n",
    "waterproof to have a better view, talking all the time rather to\n",
    "himself than to us. \"These are young McCarthy's feet. Twice he\n",
    "was walking, and once he ran swiftly, so that the soles are\n",
    "deeply marked and the heels hardly visible. That bears out his\n",
    "story. He ran when he saw his father on the ground. Then here are\n",
    "the father's feet as he paced up and down. What is this, then? It\n",
    "is the butt-end of the gun as the son stood listening. And this?\n",
    "Ha, ha! What have we here? Tiptoes! tiptoes! Square, too, quite\n",
    "unusual boots! They come, they go, they come again--of course\n",
    "that was for the cloak. Now where did they come from?\" He ran up\n",
    "and down, sometimes losing, sometimes finding the track until we\n",
    "were well within the edge of the wood and under the shadow of a\n",

    "his face with a little cry of satisfaction. For a long time he\n",
    "remained there, turning over the leaves and dried sticks,\n",
    "gathering up what seemed to me to be dust into an envelope and\n",
    "examining with his lens not only the ground but even the bark of\n",
    "the tree as far as he could reach. A jagged stone was lying among\n",
    "the moss, and this also he carefully examined and retained. Then\n",
    "he followed a pathway through the wood until he came to the\n",

    "returning to his natural manner. \"I fancy that this grey house on\n",
    "the right must be the lodge. I think that I will go in and have a\n",
    "word with Moran, and perhaps write a little note. Having done\n",
    "that, we may drive back to our luncheon. You may walk to the cab,\n",
    "and I shall be with you presently.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "It was about ten minutes before we regained our cab and drove\n",
    "back into Ross, Holmes still carrying with him the stone which he\n",
    "had picked up in the wood.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"This may interest you, Lestrade,\" he remarked, holding it out.\n",
    "\"The murder was done with it.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"I see no marks.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"There are none.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"How do you know, then?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"The grass was growing under it. It had only lain there a few\n",

    "corresponds with the injuries. There is no sign of any other\n",
    "weapon.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"And the murderer?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Is a tall man, left-handed, limps with the right leg, wears\n",
    "thick-soled shooting-boots and a grey cloak, smokes Indian\n",
    "cigars, uses a cigar-holder, and carries a blunt pen-knife in his\n",
    "pocket. There are several other indications, but these may be\n",
    "enough to aid us in our search.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Lestrade laughed. \"I am afraid that I am still a sceptic,\" he\n",
    "said. \"Theories are all very well, but we have to deal with a\n",
    "hard-headed British jury.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Nous verrons,\" answered Holmes calmly. \"You work your own\n",
    "method, and I shall work mine. I shall be busy this afternoon,\n",
    "and shall probably return to London by the evening train.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"And leave your case unfinished?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"No, finished.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"But the mystery?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"It is solved.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Who was the criminal, then?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"The gentleman I describe.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"But who is he?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Surely it would not be difficult to find out. This is not such a\n",
    "populous neighbourhood.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Lestrade shrugged his shoulders. \"I am a practical man,\" he said,\n",
    "\"and I really cannot undertake to go about the country looking\n",
    "for a left-handed gentleman with a game leg. I should become the\n",
    "laughing-stock of Scotland Yard.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"All right,\" said Holmes quietly. \"I have given you the chance.\n",
    "Here are your lodgings. Good-bye. I shall drop you a line before\n",
    "I leave.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Having left Lestrade at his rooms, we drove to our hotel, where\n",
    "we found lunch upon the table. Holmes was silent and buried in\n",
    "thought with a pained expression upon his face, as one who finds\n",
    "himself in a perplexing position.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Look here, Watson,\" he said when the cloth was cleared \"just sit\n",
    "down in this chair and let me preach to you for a little. I don't\n",
    "know quite what to do, and I should value your advice. Light a\n",
    "cigar and let me expound.\"\n",
    "\n",
    " \"Pray do so.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Well, now, in considering this case there are two points about\n",
    "young McCarthy's narrative which struck us both instantly,\n",
    "although they impressed me in his favour and you against him. One\n",
    "was the fact that his father should, according to his account,\n",
    "cry 'Cooee!' before seeing him. The other was his singular dying\n",
    "reference to a rat. He mumbled several words, you understand, but\n",
    "that was all that caught the son's ear. Now from this double\n",
    "point our research must commence, and we will begin it by\n",
    "presuming that what the lad says is absolutely true.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"What of this 'Cooee!' then?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Well, obviously it could not have been meant for the son. The\n",
    "son, as far as he knew, was in Bristol. It was mere chance that\n",
    "he was within earshot. The 'Cooee!' was meant to attract the\n",
    "attention of whoever it was that he had the appointment with. But\n",
    "'Cooee' is a distinctly Australian cry, and one which is used\n",
    "between Australians. There is a strong presumption that the\n",
    "person whom McCarthy expected to meet him at Boscombe Pool was\n",
    "someone who had been in Australia.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"What of the rat, then?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Sherlock Holmes took a folded paper from his pocket and flattened\n",
    "it out on the table. \"This is a map of the Colony of Victoria,\"\n",
    "he said. \"I wired to Bristol for it last night.\" He put his hand\n",
    "over part of the map. \"What do you read?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"ARAT,\" I read.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"And now?\" He raised his hand.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"BALLARAT.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Quite so. That was the word the man uttered, and of which his\n",
    "son only caught the last two syllables. He was trying to utter\n",
    "the name of his murderer. So and so, of Ballarat.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"It is wonderful!\" I exclaimed.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"It is obvious. And now, you see, I had narrowed the field down\n",
    "considerably. The possession of a grey garment was a third point\n",
    "which, granting the son's statement to be correct, was a\n",
    "certainty. We have come now out of mere vagueness to the definite\n",
    "conception of an Australian from Ballarat with a grey cloak.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Certainly.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"And one who was at home in the district, for the pool can only\n",
    "be approached by the farm or by the estate, where strangers could\n",
    "hardly wander.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Quite so.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Then comes our expedition of to-day. By an examination of the\n",
    "ground I gained the trifling details which I gave to that\n",
    "imbecile Lestrade, as to the personality of the criminal.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"But how did you gain them?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"You know my method. It is founded upon the observation of\n",
    "trifles.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"His height I know that you might roughly judge from the length\n",
    "of his stride. His boots, too, might be told from their traces.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Yes, they were peculiar boots.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"But his lameness?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"The impression of his right foot was always less distinct than\n",
    "his left. He put less weight upon it. Why? Because he limped--he\n",
    "was lame.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"But his left-handedness.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"You were yourself struck by the nature of the injury as recorded\n",
    "by the surgeon at the inquest. The blow was struck from\n",
    "immediately behind, and yet was upon the left side. Now, how can\n",
    "that be unless it were by a left-handed man? He had stood behind\n",
    "that tree during the interview between the father and son. He had\n",
    "even smoked there. I found the ash of a cigar, which my special\n",
    "knowledge of tobacco ashes enables me to pronounce as an Indian\n",
    "cigar. I have, as you know, devoted some attention to this, and\n",
    "written a little monograph on the ashes of 140 different\n",
    "varieties of pipe, cigar, and cigarette tobacco. Having found the\n",
    "ash, I then looked round and discovered the stump among the moss\n",
    "where he had tossed it. It was an Indian cigar, of the variety\n",
    "which are rolled in Rotterdam.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"And the cigar-holder?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"I could see that the end had not been in his mouth. Therefore he\n",
    "used a holder. The tip had been cut off, not bitten off, but the\n",
    "cut was not a clean one, so I deduced a blunt pen-knife.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Holmes,\" I said, \"you have drawn a net round this man from which\n",
    "he cannot escape, and you have saved an innocent human life as\n",
    "truly as if you had cut the cord which was hanging him. I see the\n",
    "direction in which all this points. The culprit is--\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Mr. John Turner,\" cried the hotel waiter, opening the door of\n",
    "our sitting-room, and ushering in a visitor.\n",
    "\n",
    "The man who entered was a strange and impressive figure. His\n",
    "slow, limping step and bowed shoulders gave the appearance of\n",
    "decrepitude, and yet his hard, deep-lined, craggy features, and\n",
    "his enormous limbs showed that he was possessed of unusual\n",
    "strength of body and of character. His tangled beard, grizzled\n",
    "hair, and outstanding, drooping eyebrows combined to give an air\n",
    "of dignity and power to his appearance, but his face was of an\n",
    "ashen white, while his lips and the corners of his nostrils were\n",
    "tinged with a shade of blue. It was clear to me at a glance that\n",
    "he was in the grip of some deadly and chronic disease.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Pray sit down on the sofa,\" said Holmes gently. \"You had my\n",
    "note?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Yes, the lodge-keeper brought it up. You said that you wished to\n",
    "see me here to avoid scandal.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"I thought people would talk if I went to the Hall.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"And why did you wish to see me?\" He looked across at my\n",
    "companion with despair in his weary eyes, as though his question\n",
    "was already answered.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Yes,\" said Holmes, answering the look rather than the words. \"It\n",
    "is so. I know all about McCarthy.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "The old man sank his face in his hands. \"God help me!\" he cried.\n",
    "\"But I would not have let the young man come to harm. I give you\n",
    "my word that I would have spoken out if it went against him at\n",
    "the Assizes.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"I am glad to hear you say so,\" said Holmes gravely.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"I would have spoken now had it not been for my dear girl. It\n",
    "would break her heart--it will break her heart when she hears\n",
    "that I am arrested.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"It may not come to that,\" said Holmes.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"What?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"I am no official agent. I understand that it was your daughter\n",
    "who required my presence here, and I am acting in her interests.\n",
    "Young McCarthy must be got off, however.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"I am a dying man,\" said old Turner. \"I have had diabetes for\n",
    "years. My doctor says it is a question whether I shall live a\n",
    "month. Yet I would rather die under my own roof than in a gaol.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Holmes rose and sat down at the table with his pen in his hand\n",
    "and a bundle of paper before him. \"Just tell us the truth,\" he\n",
    "said. \"I shall jot down the facts. You will sign it, and Watson\n",
    "here can witness it. Then I could produce your confession at the\n",
    "last extremity to save young McCarthy. I promise you that I shall\n",
    "not use it unless it is absolutely needed.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"It's as well,\" said the old man; \"it's a question whether I\n",
    "shall live to the Assizes, so it matters little to me, but I\n",
    "should wish to spare Alice the shock. And now I will make the\n",
    "thing clear to you; it has been a long time in the acting, but\n",
    "will not take me long to tell.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"You didn't know this dead man, McCarthy. He was a devil\n",
    "incarnate. I tell you that. God keep you out of the clutches of\n",
    "such a man as he. His grip has been upon me these twenty years,\n",
    "and he has blasted my life. I'll tell you first how I came to be\n",
    "in his power.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"It was in the early '60's at the diggings. I was a young chap\n",
    "then, hot-blooded and reckless, ready to turn my hand at\n",
    "anything; I got among bad companions, took to drink, had no luck\n",
    "with my claim, took to the bush, and in a word became what you\n",
    "would call over here a highway robber. There were six of us, and\n",
    "we had a wild, free life of it, sticking up a station from time\n",
    "to time, or stopping the wagons on the road to the diggings.\n",
    "Black Jack of Ballarat was the name I went under, and our party\n",
    "is still remembered in the colony as the Ballarat Gang.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"One day a gold convoy came down from Ballarat to Melbourne, and\n",
    "we lay in wait for it and attacked it. There were six troopers\n",
    "and six of us, so it was a close thing, but we emptied four of\n",
    "their saddles at the first volley. Three of our boys were killed,\n",
    "however, before we got the swag. I put my pistol to the head of\n",
    "the wagon-driver, who was this very man McCarthy. I wish to the\n",
    "Lord that I had shot him then, but I spared him, though I saw his\n",
    "wicked little eyes fixed on my face, as though to remember every\n",
    "feature. We got away with the gold, became wealthy men, and made\n",
    "our way over to England without being suspected. There I parted\n",
    "from my old pals and determined to settle down to a quiet and\n",
    "respectable life. I bought this estate, which chanced to be in\n",
    "the market, and I set myself to do a little good with my money,\n",
    "to make up for the way in which I had earned it. I married, too,\n",
    "and though my wife died young she left me my dear little Alice.\n",
    "Even when she was just a baby her wee hand seemed to lead me down\n",
    "the right path as nothing else had ever done. In a word, I turned\n",
    "over a new leaf and did my best to make up for the past. All was\n",
    "going well when McCarthy laid his grip upon me.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"I had gone up to town about an investment, and I met him in\n",
    "Regent Street with hardly a coat to his back or a boot to his\n",
    "foot.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"'Here we are, Jack,' says he, touching me on the arm; 'we'll be\n",
    "as good as a family to you. There's two of us, me and my son, and\n",
    "you can have the keeping of us. If you don't--it's a fine,\n",
    "law-abiding country is England, and there's always a policeman\n",
    "within hail.'\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Well, down they came to the west country, there was no shaking\n",
    "them off, and there they have lived rent free on my best land\n",
    "ever since. There was no rest for me, no peace, no forgetfulness;\n",
    "turn where I would, there was his cunning, grinning face at my\n",
    "elbow. It grew worse as Alice grew up, for he soon saw I was more\n",
    "afraid of her knowing my past than of the police. Whatever he\n",
    "wanted he must have, and whatever it was I gave him without\n",
    "question, land, money, houses, until at last he asked a thing\n",
    "which I could not give. He asked for Alice.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"His son, you see, had grown up, and so had my girl, and as I was\n",
    "known to be in weak health, it seemed a fine stroke to him that\n",
    "his lad should step into the whole property. But there I was\n",
    "firm. I would not have his cursed stock mixed with mine; not that\n",
    "I had any dislike to the lad, but his blood was in him, and that\n",
    "was enough. I stood firm. McCarthy threatened. I braved him to do\n",
    "his worst. We were to meet at the pool midway between our houses\n",
    "to talk it over.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"When I went down there I found him talking with his son, so I\n",
    "smoked a cigar and waited behind a tree until he should be alone.\n",
    "But as I listened to his talk all that was black and bitter in\n",
    "me seemed to come uppermost. He was urging his son to marry my\n",
    "daughter with as little regard for what she might think as if she\n",
    "were a slut from off the streets. It drove me mad to think that I\n",
    "and all that I held most dear should be in the power of such a\n",
    "man as this. Could I not snap the bond? I was already a dying and\n",
    "a desperate man. Though clear of mind and fairly strong of limb,\n",
    "I knew that my own fate was sealed. But my memory and my girl!\n",
    "Both could be saved if I could but silence that foul tongue. I\n",
    "did it, Mr. Holmes. I would do it again. Deeply as I have sinned,\n",
    "I have led a life of martyrdom to atone for it. But that my girl\n",
    "should be entangled in the same meshes which held me was more\n",
    "than I could suffer. I struck him down with no more compunction\n",
    "than if he had been some foul and venomous beast. His cry brought\n",
    "back his son; but I had gained the cover of the wood, though I\n",
    "was forced to go back to fetch the cloak which I had dropped in\n",
    "my flight. That is the true story, gentlemen, of all that\n",
    "occurred.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Well, it is not for me to judge you,\" said Holmes as the old man\n",
    "signed the statement which had been drawn out. \"I pray that we\n",
    "may never be exposed to such a temptation.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"I pray not, sir. And what do you intend to do?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"In view of your health, nothing. You are yourself aware that you\n",
    "will soon have to answer for your deed at a higher court than the\n",
    "Assizes. I will keep your confession, and if McCarthy is\n",
    "condemned I shall be forced to use it. If not, it shall never be\n",
    "seen by mortal eye; and your secret, whether you be alive or\n",
    "dead, shall be safe with us.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Farewell, then,\" said the old man solemnly. \"Your own deathbeds,\n",
    "when they come, will be the easier for the thought of the peace\n",
    "which you have given to mine.\" Tottering and shaking in all his\n",
    "giant frame, he stumbled slowly from the room.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"God help us!\" said Holmes after a long silence. \"Why does fate\n",
    "play such tricks with poor, helpless worms? I never hear of such\n",
    "a case as this that I do not think of Baxter's words, and say,\n",
    "'There, but for the grace of God, goes Sherlock Holmes.'\"\n",
    "\n",
    "James McCarthy was acquitted at the Assizes on the strength of a\n",
    "number of objections which had been drawn out by Holmes and\n",
    "submitted to the defending counsel. Old Turner lived for seven\n",
    "months after our interview, but he is now dead; and there is\n",
    "every prospect that the son and daughter may come to live happily\n",
    "together in ignorance of the black cloud which rests upon their\n",

    "# Text Similarity\n",
    "\n",
    "Most of us have a good autocorrect story. Our phone’s messenger quietly swaps one letter for another as we type and suddenly the meaning of our message has changed (to our horror or pleasure). However, addressing text similarity — including spelling correction — is a major challenge within natural language processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Addressing word similarity and misspelling for spellcheck or autocorrect often involves considering the Levenshtein distance or minimal edit distance between two words. The distance is calculated through the minimum number of insertions, deletions, and substitutions that would need to occur for one word to become another. For example, turning “bees” into “beans” would require one substitution (“a” for “e”) and one insertion (“n”), so the Levenshtein distance would be two.\n",
    "\n",
    "Phonetic similarity is also a major challenge within speech recognition. English-speaking humans can easily tell from context whether someone said “euthanasia” or “youth in Asia,” but it’s a far more challenging task for a machine! More advanced autocorrect and spelling correction technology additionally considers key distance on a keyboard and phonetic similarity (how much two words or phrases sound the same).\n",
    "\n",
    "It’s also helpful to find out if texts are the same to guard against plagiarism, which we can identify through lexical similarity (the degree to which texts use the same vocabulary and phrases). Meanwhile, semantic similarity (the degree to which documents contain similar meaning or topics) is useful when you want to find (or recommend) an article or book similar to one you recently finished."

    "# Language Prediction & Text Generation\n",
    "\n",
    "How does your favorite search engine complete your search queries? How does your phone’s keyboard know what you want to type next? Language prediction is an application of NLP concerned with predicting text given preceding text. Autosuggest, autocomplete, and suggested replies are common forms of language prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your first step to language prediction is picking a language model. Bag of words alone is generally not a great model for language prediction; no matter what the preceding word was, you will just get one of the most commonly used words from your training corpus.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you go the n-gram route, you will most likely rely on Markov chains to predict the statistical likelihood of each following word (or character) based on the training corpus. Markov chains are memory-less and make statistical predictions based entirely on the current n-gram on hand.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, let’s take a sentence beginning, “I ate so many grilled cheese”. Using a trigram model (where n is 3), a Markov chain would predict the following word as “sandwiches” based on the number of times the sequence “grilled cheese sandwiches” has appeared in the training data out of all the times “grilled cheese” has appeared in the training data.\n",
    "\n",
    "A more advanced approach, using a neural language model, is the Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) model. LSTM uses deep learning with a network of artificial “cells” that manage memory, making them better suited for text prediction than traditional neural networks."
